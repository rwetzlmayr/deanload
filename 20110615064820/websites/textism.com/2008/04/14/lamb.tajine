<h3><span class="outleft">14 Apr 2008, 11am</span></h3>

<p>This is good, my friend. It will transform you. </p>
<p>Getcherself a kilogram or so of lamb or mutton shoulder and/or shank, and have the butcher saw both meat and bone into manageable chunks.</p>
<p>Prepare three litres of an 8% brine solution. 8% = 80g salt per litre of water, so dissolve 240g salt in as little boiling water as will absorb it, then add enough ice water (the solution should be as close to freezing as possible) to make three litres. Brine the meat in a big ol’ zip-loc bag in the fridge for a good six hours – I wouldn’t go overnight, it’ll get too salty – then drain, rinse, and let the pieces air-dry in the fridge, ideally overnight.</p>
<p>Brown the meat quickly but thoroughly in olive oil until nicely coloured. The ideal vessel here is the heavy cast-iron dutch oven in which the dish will complete its cooking, though any ovenproof, large metal pot will get the job done. When browning, work in small batches, as you need adequate space between pieces for steam to escape, elsewise the sugars in the meat will melt and boil rather than caramelise.</p>
<p>While the meat browns, use a mortar and pestle or food processor to mash together a rough paste of chopped fresh green or red chiles (as many, and as hot, as you can stand), shredded fresh ginger, smashed garlic cloves, minced shallots, chopped fresh coriander (leaves and stems), black peppercorns and olive oil. You should end up with half a cup of paste.</p>
<p>Put the browned meat aside and pour off any burnt oil left in the pot before frying the paste in fresh oil for a minute or so, stirring and scraping constantly. Return the meat to the pot and arrange in a fairly tight layer. Cover with water or stock and bring to a boil while dicing up a cup or so each of sweet potato, carrot and onion. (During this first stovetop braise these vegetables will fall apart, thickening and enriching the braising liquid, so don’t worry about being tidy.)</p>
<p><span class="outright">It’s crucial this first braise be done with the meat on the bone: basically you’re making a good lamb stock <em>in situ.</em></span></p>
<p>Add the chopped vegetables along with a couple teaspoons of the spice mixture <a href="http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/recipes/display/recipe_id/799/">ras al-hanut</a>, a generous squeeze of honey and a splodge of tomato paste. Let the pot bubble just at the boil. After 90 minutes or so start checking to see if the meat is becoming fall-off-the-bone tender. Once it is, remove it, set aside to cool, then separate and discard the bones. Set the oven to 150°.</p>
<p>Presentation vegetables can now be added, with the deboned meat, to the broth: any combination you like of small firm potatoes, sliced sweet potatoes, chunks of carrot, quartered tomatoes, small peeled or large quartered onions, maybe chickpeas. These will be given a slow even braise in the oven, and should retain their shape and colour to the end.</p>
<p>Add a handful of dried apricots, check for salt, and bring back to a boil before placing the covered pot in the oven for at least an hour, until the vegetables are tender but still firm.</p>
<p>Spoon onto couscous, with chopped fresh coriander. Om nom nom nom.</p>
