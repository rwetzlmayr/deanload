<h3><span class="outleft">25 Apr 2008, 5pm</span></h3>

<p>I am as they say hereabouts <em>nul</em> when it comes to taking photographs. As a designer slash art director I think I had a fairly good eye for what makes a picture work, and what makes one work in a layout – at least I hope so, wouldn’t want those thousands of hours spent squinting into loupes over light tables saying <em>nope nope nope</em> to have amounted to nothing. When it comes to taking the things myself though, always a frustration. Press the shutter release, hope for the best, and never ever end up with what was expected (well, maybe <a href="http://textism.com/photos/?s=8&amp;p=75" title="Bad Dog">once</a>). Not entirely unversed in the logic of exposure time and apertures, but ultimately just too impatient to develop anything like the supple knowledge photographers whose work I like can access in an instant. That and I’ve been using the wrong goddamn cameras.</p>
<p>For years now I’ve used Leica (or more often the Panasonic Lumix versions, which have the same glass and electronics but come much cheaper) consumer-end cameras, mainly because some lingering art school snobbery I picked up as a teenager dictates that anything Leica or Hasselblad marks you as a better photographer than any Japanese silliness ever possibly could. True or not (not) the pictures kept turning out wrong: impossible to get a good white balance in anything other than direct sunlight, noisy junk all over the place at any speed greater than 100 <span class="caps">ASA</span>, slippery autofocus that took, like, a couple <em>hours</em> to lock in before firing the shutter. Finally it dawned on me after a few years of blind brand allegiance what Leica’s consumer products are: a brilliant, razor-sharp lens up front, a webcam on back.</p>
<p>I’ve always been reluctant to use a <span class="caps">DSLR</span> – the one sure thing about being an expat is you never want to look like a tourist – however having just this week received a lump sum payment that has at long last made its way through the barely perceptible movements of the rusty squeaking gears that is accounts payable at a certain publishing concern that shall remain, er, unnamed, I did two capricious things I’d been champing at the bit to do for ages: bought Herself (who is, justifiably, more than a little tired of being given my smoked and smudged hand-me-downs) a bright shiny white portable computing device, and myself a Nikon D60, with the standard vanilla 18–55mm kit lens. After all I’m now at the stage in life where, looks-wise, coming off as a tourist occupies the least of my concern.</p>
<p class="photo"><img src="/img/first_fly_20080425_075236_sm.jpg" alt="Photo of the first spring fly spotted this year" width="800" height="537" /></p>
<p><span class="outleft">First fly spotted this year. Many billions more will come.</span></p>
<p>Christ on a <em>bike</em> what a difference. I feel like someone handed a slice of hot toast spread with cultured butter after a lifetime breakfasting on Skittles and government cheese. I mean, it does what I want it to! It autofocuses in less time than it takes my eyes to imagine what a proper focus would be! You can take pictures in tungsten light without tacking a fucking white card to the wall and metering fifteen times! You push the button and it takes a fucking picture! I am in consumer ecstasy! I am in consumer ecstasy! NyQuil! Advil! Malt liquor! </p>
<p>Ahem. Gonna go take pictures of my feet.</p>
