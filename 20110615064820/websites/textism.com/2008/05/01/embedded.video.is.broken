<h3><span class="outleft">1 May 2008, 3pm</span></h3>

<p>The highlights of my first trip to Europe, at the age of nineteen, were as follows: getting mugged at knifepoint by a tweaking mass of dreadlocks in Amsterdam (followed by a delightfully sleepless, dehydrated night in a hostel built by Satan himself); hearing, with stunned disbelief, a person of Japanese heritage speak in a cockney accent; and sitting on a Tate Gallery bench staring at the paintings of Francis Bacon, whose work I spent all my late teens and early twenties pretending to understand (still don’t, twenty years on, but continue to enjoy the hell out of).</p>
<p>I was going to tell you about <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=QhaqwlZxJZI">this magnificent South Bank Show</a> on Bacon, made around the same time as that trip (the best bit is the lunch, but do watch all six parts), and now that I’ve done that (just there, a few words back) I realise it’s been, what, twenty seconds since I rattled on all high and mighty and finger-pointy about some user interface issue, so let us then consider for a moment that embedded video is broken.</p>
<p>To my mind the point of failure lies at offering only two options to the viewer: stay locked onto the web page, which, no matter the site, is like watching a dancing bear on a television being carried by a dancing bear, or go full-screen, which, given both the resolution thang and one’s god-given ability to perform more than one activity at a time, is rarely attractive.</p>
<p><span class="outright">I know it’s possible to sneak in the back door of some video sharing sites and download files to watch on a standalone player, but that’s no solution to the problem.</span></p>
<p>This happens several times a day: I find myself at Youtube or Vimeo or Brightcove or wherever, begin watching something interesting, and immediately start looking for a way to put that in a corner of my screen so I can continue working or doing, um, research, and cast my eyes back to it whenever interest demands I do so. This evidently can’t be done using any of the popular embedded video gear, so I end up resizing the browser window (which results in layout chaos) and opening up a fresh window to resume what I was doing before. This is lame, this is broken.</p>
<p>Please Mr Internets, make a standard embedded video solution that allows us to pop up an actual-size window in which to watch the dancing bears while we continue to save the world. Thanks in advance.</p>
