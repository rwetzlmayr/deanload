<h3><span class="outleft">16 May 2008, 3pm</span></h3>

<p>You’ll agree that, of all the Twitter-related apps springing forth every couple hours, few have much real use. <a href="http://summize.com">Summize</a> seems to be doing a pretty good job offering real-time search of a mountain of 140-character detritus, but all the others just tap the public timeline and process it using basic business logic. When it comes to filtering for quality, the only show so far seems to be Ono Matope’s <a href="http://favotter.com">Favotter</a>, but it’s slow as heck, and the English-language section there is seriously undermaintained. Also, the pool of people whose favourites are polled seems to be locked at the 950 or so who, at the time of Favotter’s launch, had the largest number of ‘favourited’ items. This, to be unfair, is a bit like being recommended music by that weird single guy who goes to see a different band every night.</p>
<p>So I spent the last few days knocking <a href="http://textism.com/favrd">this</a> together. It works on three principles: first, that anyone who wants to can have their vote counted; second, that things people find interesting are more important than people who find things interesting; and third, that by any means necessary, web-strategy, social-media, online-marketing webcocks – unaware as they are of how toxic their presence is in the arenas they cannot shut up about – must and shall be filtered out of view.</p>
<p>There’s some fancy albeit inchoate weighting logic going on under the surface, and I’ve got a few vaguely neato features in the works, though it is as they say very beta. It will I hope grow, and, as more people are added to the voting ranks, be a reliable source for funny, weird, obnoxious, entertaining, inspiring, webcock-less, tiny little fragments of life.</p>
