<h3>Back a Winner <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/113/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">9 APRIL 01</span></h3>
<p>When I was a kid I used to imagine what it was going to be like. Fantasies of being a grownup, or at least some cartoon approximation thereof, were constant: always some grand distant place where everyone took you seriously and you could go to bed whenever you felt like it. Part of this daydreaming, of course, included an amazing place to live (equipped with huge machines and the ability to stop time), and a rich, dense neighbourhood &#8211; the people that you meet, as you&#8217;re walking down the street; butcher, baker, candlestick maker.</p><p>So here I am. In my neighbourhood (densely populated, near the beach and park, generally high quality of life) the rents are high. The landowners gouge. Here, in my neighbourhood, a curious and inevitable thing happens to anyone who tries to open their own business.</p><p>I suppose it&#8217;s fair to say that the onetime universal fantasy of running one&#8217;s own business, of selling quality things or serving quality food to a loyal, local clientele, was rendered unviable long ago. Anyone who wants to open a boutique or diner or specialty shop will soon have a five hundred pound gorilla of multinational franchise either opening up next door or strangling supply chains. Add that to obscene rents from gouging landlords, and your mom and pop operation isn&#8217;t going to be around for long. </p><p>In my neighbourhood there&#8217;s a pattern. New shop opens, full of stuff. Owner is optimistic, feeling independent and in charge. Owner sees the hundred thousand people living nearby walking past every day, dressed nicely, well fed, and soon wonders why they aren&#8217;t coming in. The owner advertises, to no effect. The people keep walking by, carrying packages from The Gap and bags of burgers from McDonald&#8217;s and still continuing not to come in. And then the blowout sales start. The dramatically reduced prices. The everything marked down. The For Lease.</p><p>On the downward slide (there&#8217;s always a slide, nothing without a head office and team leaders will survive, it seems) I see them, the owners, standing out front, window shopping their own establishments, smoking. Wondering what the hell is going on, what they did wrong. I walk by, involuntarily avoiding eye contact, amazed there&#8217;s nothing to be done. </p><p>The people that you meet.</p>
