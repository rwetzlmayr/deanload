	<h3><a href="http://textism.com/article/164/layered" title="Permanent link to this article">Layered</a> &#183;  3 May 2001</h3>
<p>A decade ago, when I worked a little harder at being a tangibly pretentious <a href="http://textism.com/bucket/pisher.html" title="Portrait of the author as a young wanker">wanker</a> &#8211; now I&#8217;m just sort of phoning in my wanker pretence; coasting on it, really &#8211; I used old technical manuals (for things like glaucoma testing apparatus, or field machine-gun cleaning and assembly) as notebooks, writing over the existing text with a Sharpie, stopping now and again to let a particularly beguiling illustration or passage shine through. I wouldn&#8217;t hope to recall what was recorded: intense analysis of hangovers, annotated conversations, letters never sent. <i>Why can&#8217;t she admit we&#8217;re meant for each other,</i> etc.</p><p>Around that time I started pretending to be a designer. In the lucky situation of having a job in publishing, I was able to study and learn while paying the rent, and it was relatively easy to ride out the long interval I now refer to as The Time of Fucking Up (~3 years), which all designers must traverse before their work should be considered street legal.</p><p>I&#8217;d always been a reader, but having worked for years in a bookstore, constantly surrounded by books and intimidated by the knowledge of the people who&#8217;d read all the books, I was fully confident that anything I had to say would be singularly unimportant. The first few thousand things I designed inevitably seemed all wrong (in retrospect, most were), but I defended them to the death, as though each project were a child to be protected, while worrying &#8211; to extend the metaphor &#8211; that, due to poor parenting, the child would grow up all wrong, to vote Canadian Alliance or sell mobile phones or listen to Sarah McLachlan.</p><p>So, in hindsight, two forces of uncertainty influenced the work: mistrust of the basic message, and an urge to obscure anything that might be wrong by burying it in layers &#8211; text on top of text, image buried inside image, multiple messages, frames, filtering, tricks with the digital tools. It&#8217;s sort of like tap dancing to divert attention from the way you walk.</p><p>If you&#8217;d asked at the time, I would have said I did what I did because I wanted to do something different, not to be boring. But now, clicking around the web, flipping through the printed landscape, I see there&#8217;s nothing boring about clarity, at least when it comes to the arrangement of information.</p><p>The Time of Fucking Up also applies to writing, of course. Still in the thick of that.</p>
