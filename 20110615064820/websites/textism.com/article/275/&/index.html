	<h3><a href="http://textism.com/article/275/unearned" title="Permanent link to this article">Unearned</a> &#183; 28 June 2001</h3>
<p>My mind is clouded with unnecessary information about celebrities. Why do I even know who Robbie Williams is? How could I ever have wasted a second considering the existence of Drew Barrymore? Isn&#8217;t Edward Norton&#8217;s fling with Courtney Love the sort of thing you wish you never knew? What deal was done, what ocean was crossed, what jungle was plundered, that Geri Halliwell would become a name I even know?</p>

<p>There are those, like Jim Carrey, who annoy the fuck out of me, yet have some sort of gift, and hence deserve fame. But how does anyone explain Jennifer Aniston? I think it&#8217;s time we took stock of the unnecessarily famous:</p>

<li>I actually troubled myself to read a lengthy interview with Sarah Michelle Gellar, to figure out if my seemingly unfounded dislike of her could be justified.  I found her exceptionally bland and bubble-headed--why is she getting work, shen she can't even act?<br />

<li>I can understand why some people get work, just cause they're pretty faces.

But why Giovanni Ribisi. Neither smart, funny, attractive, or a good actor. You'd think Hollywood would have never picked him up, or even continued giving him roles.<br />

<li>I used to watch the tonight show with jay leno until one night rob riener was on there spouting some cute little family story about teaching his sons to protect the "family jewels." At that very moment I realized that these are other people's lives and for some jacked up reason, I was sitting there waisting my time learning about someone I didn't know, didn't care to know, and I was taking it all in as if it was fucking trivia. what celebrity? all of 'em. (but my current ponderance is Rick Fox, the basketball player for the Lakers. I saw him on OZ and he was just a thug.)<br />

The only redeeming band was Black Sabbath. 

But back to Manson. Maybe I'm jaded, but he really didn't do or say anything shocking. And the music: it's like a bunch of Florida High School goth kids learning to play their instrume... oh... wait.

And the visuals weren't shocking at all. I mean, it's not like they showed a video of someone eating poo after it came out of another person's rectum. Not that I've ever seen that. I'm just saying that that is really gross, and Mr. manson isn't gross. He's just another pop star leeching the potential free-thinking out of today's teenagers.<br />

<li>Regarding wil's saying above that: 
"the fact that brad pitt was in fight club still scares the fuck out of me.",

The only reason for that movie was so we could all hear Brad Pitt deliver the line where he says: "we were all told we were going to be movie gods (etcc)....but we're not!!  We're the all singing..."  How great is that?!

Ironic, or moronic?  Hmmm

Oh, I also hate Jim Carrey for being a pandering twit.

<li>But Kaplan would be recognized on the street, you know, especially back then. So he isn't a super-celeb, but he has/had enough celebrity that is/was ludicrously undeserved when you consider his low entertainment value, silly physical appearance,
lame comedic apparati, sophomoric advice to the Sweathogs, self-pleased demeanour, and stage-presence akin to Tarantino when he shows up on camera. You just wince and WISH he'd get off the set. So I stand by Gabe Kaplan even if he wasn't given great celebrity. He was given more than he deserved. 
Oh I want to agree with Bob Saget. Good call. <br />

<li>I disagree about Kato Kaylin. Just yesterday I was with my family at a trendy restaurant and I referred to a fellow I noticed as being a "Kato Kaylin" type and everyone understood exactly what I meant. Kato doesn't deserve fame on his own, but the fact that he's the world's most famous "house guest" has adjectival(tm) value.

Come to think of it, we ought to be able to use Regis as an adjective these days: he's become a parody of a parody of himself.

As for useless fame, I'd choose Darrell Hannah.<br />

<li>It hit me tonight that there are some constructs of celebrity for which I'm grateful: Never had the slightest inclination to listen to Depeche Mode, so the only thing I know about them is there's this guy with the worst haircuts of the late 20th century, and the singer who turns into a junkie every time the band needs more press.
