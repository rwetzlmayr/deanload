	<h3><a href="http://textism.com/article/325/distortion-and-feedback" title="Permanent link to this article">Distortion and Feedback</a> &#183;  8 April 2001</h3>
<p>
	The first desktop publishing applications, going back to MacWrite 1.0 (48 Kb installed) in 1984, had, under the influence of the great interface designer <a href="http://www.kare.com/fontportfolio.html" title="Susan Kare&#8217;s Portfolio - Fonts">Susan Kare</a>, a wonderful whimsy when it came to fonts and design. Acknowledging, even celebrating, the coarseness of the screen and printed environment of the first Macintoshes, those early applications played around. And it was great fun.
</p>
<p>
	Those playful tools, those buttons that made drop shadows and outlines and super-emphasized text with underlines, shadows, slanting, added weight, and so on, became irrelevant once PostScript font technology came along, and the Mac became a serious design tool, able to hold its own with phototypesetting machines and pasteup artists.
</p>
<p>
	But as developers started rushing to cash in on the new gold rush of publishing for everyone, everything about the first Mac apps became a template from which to steal, including dumb font tools specific to the original 72 dpi print environment. 
</p>
<p>
	And, all these years later, ruinously expensive software with ostensibly first-rate user interfaces and design tools still place these tools right front and centre. Microsoft Word 2001 for Macintosh puts in its default formatting bar buttons for bold, italic, bold italic, small caps, drop shadow, superscript and subscript formatting, all of which provide immediate opportunity for the writer to destroy his text. And so, destroy he does. 
</p>
<p>
	Tried and true methods of textual differentiation, methods in use for hundreds of years, which at last are fully available to anyone using a desktop computer, are nowhere to be found. Computers can approximate the tools once available only to professional typographers, but dominant software programs, including those of the ostensible high end, are still operating as though it were 1984.
</p>
<p>
	The worst thing about this weird hangover is the likelihood of the software calling the shots, the program&#8217;s internal works deciding what text ought to look like. 
</p>
<p>
	Consider the italic. Italic type that combines well with a companion roman is a rare thing of practical beauty: humanistic strokes and tapers commingling with drawn bowls and serifs. Lyricism mixing with logic. But in a desktop publishing work environment, chances are good that calling an italic font does no such thing: it merely instructs the software to distort, skew, the letterforms a few degrees to the right, making not italic letters but sloped, distorted, roman letters.
</p>
<p>
	Take a look at the David Foster Wallace essay occupying the middle of the April <i>Harper&#8217;s</i> magazine. (<i>Harper&#8217;s</i> is continuing its eccentric habit of including stylish typefaces long out of vogue &#8211; in this case Mrs Eaves, Zuzana Licko&#8217;s ambitious and eccentric mid-&#8217;90s attempt at simulating letterpress Baskerville &#8211; alongside its bread and butter Goudy Old Style body face.) In the footnotes of the Wallace piece, Mrs Eaves is utterly brutalized at the hands of software (doubtless QuarkXpress) every single instance of &#8220;italic&#8221; text being a sloped distortion of a roman letterform. The italic font Licko designed was available, but the software called the shots at the hands of an unaware operator.
</p>
<p>
	Every month <i>Harper&#8217;s</i> offers another example of the ruination of text by software on autopilot, in the use of small caps. Small capital letters are an integral part of a text family, widely available for well-made digital font packages, but, since the early days of the Macintosh, software has placed front and centre the ability to &#8220;make&#8221; small caps, which inevitably equates to &#8220;squish a full capital letter down to a percentage of its original.&#8221; The result is a parody, a tragic approximation of the way small caps have interacted with roman upper- and lower-case letters for, again, hundreds of years.
</p>
<p>
	One day, maybe, software developers will take a look at examples already set, when imagining what the output of their products will look like.
