	<h3><a href="http://textism.com/article/467/one-year-old" title="Permanent link to this article">One Year Old!</a> &#183; 27 February 2002</h3>
	<p>The panel has spoken. Judges for the first anniversary <a href="http://www.textism.com/badtextism/" title="Textism &#187; Bad Textism Contest">Bad Textism Contest</a> have come &#8211; after much dissent &#8211; to agree on a winner.</p>

	<p>Of 63 entries received, most were very funny and charming, many were thoughtful and provocative, a few were a little unsettling in the reach of their knowledge of this site and its author, and a couple were really fucking weird. </p>

	<p>Much of the rancour over a decisive win stemmed from a clean divide that formed between entries that used the tone and style of this site as a starting point for experiment, and those that merely rearranged existing elements to comic effect. I can&#8217;t describe much of the specifics of the debate amongst judges: I chose to remain at a distance from the discussion, receiving only occasional progress updates. In this regard it was rather as though, in the trial of my crimes, I was the defense attorney, you were the prosecution (we paced the hallways of the courthouse, smoking hopefully), and the panel was the jury. Not really.</p>

	<p>Anyway, on to the winner. This entry hit directly upon what the judges were seeking, namely big laffs and a bullseye hit on my own smug derision and snarky dismissiveness. It was also the <a href="http://www.textism.com/badtextism/entries/" title="Textism &#187; Bad Textism Contest">first entry received</a>. Barry Hall, who will receive something nice in the mail, has been emailed.</p>

	<p>My gratitude to all who contributed: I laughed myself hoarse and blushed three times and was really, really flattered. Heartfelt thanks are also extended to those of you who, collectively, load this front page roughly 100,000 times a month. </p>

	<p>Do keep reading.</p>
