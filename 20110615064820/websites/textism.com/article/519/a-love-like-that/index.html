	<h3><a href="http://textism.com/article/519/a-love-like-that" title="Permanent link to this article">A Love Like That</a> &#183; 31 May 2002</h3>
<p>I never saw Dee&#8217;s face, only imagined it while I hollered down the phone line. I imagined the sort of angles and jut and long blond streaks and studio tan worn by the urban surfer dood of the time. He was the restaurant manager. I was the angry neighbour. It was 1989.</p>

	<p>A godsend apartment: the entire top floor of a crumbling walkup perched above the lifestyle porn and display-case kitsch of Robson Street, downtown Vancouver. Roof garden out back, huge rooms, bay windows. The only neighbour had the second floor, and was never there. The rent was $487 a month, of which I paid half. </p>

	<p>The street noise from Robson was constant, sure, but nothing to which you couldn&#8217;t grow accustomed. And this was the dawn of the bass cannon era: boom cars from Surrey drove up and down all night, rattling windows; bad white boys in shiny low riders, pumping the <span class="caps">NWA</span>. Sometimes we would pitch eggs at windshields and fall to the floor laughing hard.</p>

	<p>I came home one afternoon and saw, across the street, opposite my room, a sort of party taking place on the balcony of a space that had until then been boarded up. Shoulder pads and glazed cocaine smiles clinking glasses of sparkling wine, toasting &#8211; it surely must have been &#8211; a primo investment. A theme restaurant was opening; the theme was the Beatles. The menu would boast Ringo onion rings, strawberry fields shakes, octopus garden calamari, and so on. Food, fun, fab four.</p>

	<p>Late into that night, through the tin outdoor speakers, ten Beatles songs played in, as they say, heavy rotation. It would stop for a while until, I suppose, someone flipped the tape, and then the tomtom fill and <em>She loves you ya, ya, ya</em> would swell again. I remember thinking, <em>boy, I hope this party doesn&#8217;t go on too long, because this is getting annoying!</em></p>

	<p>Of course it went on for over a year. Day after day, night after night, the same ten Beatles songs played, permeating everything. Somewhere in that year I developed a tic in my eye that can still be fired off with &#8216;Norwegian Wood&#8217;. In that apartment I learned I can handle virtually any distraction &#8211; I can read calmly while roomates fuck, I can doze while hockey playoff riots surge on the street outside &#8211; but I cannot escape the ten-ton weight of the same songs, spun in a row.</p>

	<p>I learned I had no legal recourse: the street was zoned commercial, and there weren&#8217;t supposed to be any residents there at all. This was at least part of the reason why the rent was so cheap. One can&#8217;t exactly complain to City Hall from a position of illegality.</p>

	<p>The phone calls started amiably enough, I&#8217;d ask to speak to the manager, <em>hey guy, it&#8217;s after midnight and I gotta work in the morning</em> type of thing, and he (I remind you his name was Dee) would say <em>okay guy, we&#8217;ll turn it off real soon,</em> and it would go on and on. </p>

	<p>After some months I rented a small programmable signboard and propped it in my bedroom window &#8211; anyone at the restaurant who cast their eyes across the street would have seen <span class="caps">FUCK YOU FUCK YOU</span> scrolling by in <span class="caps">LED</span>, on a permanent loop. Sometimes when the restaurant was busy on a hot summer evening &#8211; a miracle, the food and service were awful &#8211; I&#8217;d open the windows wide and aim the stereo speakers across the street and play some Big Black or Scratch Acid. I wanted to <em>share,</em> you see.</p>

	<blockquote>&#8212;I see a lot of apartments over there, and you&#8217;re the only one who ever calls to complain.</blockquote>

	<blockquote>&#8212;I&#8217;m the only one here, chowderfuck!</blockquote>

	<p>It went on until the wretched, horrid, refills-free nightmare finally went out of business after thirteen months; clumsily, weakly, to the sound of numbered corporations dissolving. </p>
