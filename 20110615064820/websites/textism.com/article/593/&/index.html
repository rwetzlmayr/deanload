	<h3><a href="http://textism.com/article/593/glittery" title="Permanent link to this article">Glittery</a> &#183; 24 September 2002</h3>
	<p>Other than a brief stretch in Kitsilano and a few months on the East Side (we didn&#8217;t quite get along), I lived in Vancouver&#8217;s West End for 17 years. I liked it there. You might like it there, too.</p>

	<p>Late one night about ten years ago I was coming home over the Burrard Street Bridge; I was feeling, oh, <em>moderately</em> misanthropic, and eager to get home to bed. Swinging around the long curve by the old Coca-Cola building, traffic suddenly came to a dead halt. I was boxed in on four sides. After several minutes tapping the steering wheel and punching buttons on the radio, I got out and saw that cars were held up not because of something terrible like an accident, or merely inconvenient like road repairs: it was a film crew, shooting a scene for <cite>Highlander.</cite></p>

	<p>And thus began my long and progressively more hostile relationship with Hollywood North </p>

	<p>Somehow over the years the filmed entertainment industry managed to install itself everywhere you turned in Vancouver, particularly the West End. Turn around a corner on a walk, and <em>boom,</em> there would be the trucks and trailers, the catering table, the fat cables on the ground, and some mousy PA in a crew bomber, one hand holding a walkie-talkie, the other held up, exhorting you to stop breathing until magic was made. You&#8217;d go out to eat and find the restaurant completely overtaken by a wrap party, cocaine jittery youth in ill-fitting affordable glam, looking like they just showed up for the party after a month in the bush and a quick stop at Eaton&#8217;s. After a while it seemed that all phone conversations began with some variation on &#8216;Hi, this is [<em>name</em>], yeah, I&#8217;m working on [<em>crap TV movie</em>]&#8217;. Talent agencies boomed.</p>

	<p>The dominant &#8217;tude, of course, was that a connection to the Industry implied Hollywood once removed, so get the fuck out of my way. Tenuous cred, that, and indeed many of us outside the business couldn&#8217;t help but notice that the movies and shows we liked &#8211; vehicles for ideas and voices &#8211; just weren&#8217;t being made in Vancouver. While the Industry was purportedly injecting a billion US into the British Columbia economy every year, what it made there was crap: TV movies, straight-to-video disasters, quickie <span class="caps">HBO</span> &#8216;auteur&#8217; garbage, eye-glazing network series; so many products cynically tailored to licensing agreements and syndication, and, yes, that terrible, horrible, witless, conniving abortion known as <cite>The X-Files.</cite></p>

	<p>So when asked if I miss Vancouver, the response is that I miss my family and friends, and I miss the Cheese Deluxe with Fries at the Varsity Grill on 10th Avenue, though Mr Bing closed that years ago. I&#8217;m kind of glad, however, to be far away from the Industry.</p>

	<p>And then this morning, walking with Oliver on our usual route, I was told I had to stop and go back by someone with a crew bomber and walkie-talkie.</p>

	<p>A film is being shot in Pompignan. Seems half the population of the village has a part, including the Little Red-Haired Kid, who has an 8 <span class="caps">AM</span> call tomorrow.</p>

	<p>Flipping around late night TV a couple years ago, I happened upon the <em>Highlander</em> scene shot that night on the Burrard Street Bridge. It was a sword battle, presumably betwixt the forces of good and evil. The villain was that huge bald guy who played Bull on <cite>Night Court.</cite></p>
