	<h3><a href="http://textism.com/article/642/going-out" title="Permanent link to this article">Going Out</a> &#183;  3 December 2002</h3>
	<p>The dog has been staring for a good hour, something he commences every day at 7:14 <span class="caps">AM</span> and works hard at, an inch or two from my face, until my eyes remain open and I roll out of bed to take him down the ladder, into a collar, and out in the world to unclench. </p>

	<p>On this morning I also need to unclench with some urgency. It&#8217;s not as bad as some days &#8211; when you wake up from fever dreams of speedboating across clear lakewaters with a terry towel in your mouth and a boiling vat of kerosene in your lap &#8211; no, it&#8217;s not as bad as it can be, but as I say there is some urgency. I groan and creak and it&#8217;s on with the clothes, the socks and shoes, down the steps and past the kitchen. Every day at this exact point there&#8217;s a debate: put coffee on the stove now so it&#8217;ll be ready upon return, or deal with the bodily functions and fuss over breakfast later. I put on the coffee.</p>

	<p>There&#8217;s an entranceway. About four metres square, just a sort of anteroom between the living room and the outside world. On two of its walls are hung coats and hats and collars and leashes; on the third is the big, heavy front door; on the fourth is the door to the toilet, right beside the door to the living room, which is the only thing that lays between all of these and a very bouncy eager dog and a groggy man who has to pee with, as I say, some urgency.</p>

	<p>I try the door handle and, instead of the usual resistance one gets after turning it 45&#176; or so, indicating the latch has cleared and the door can be opened, it just keeps going. I turn it the other direction, a full three sixty. The lock, which had been acting flaky, is now quite broken; the door is essentially deadbolted from within.</p>

	<p>Pause. Stare. Try again. Pause. Oh man. Options.</p>

	<p>Kicking it goes nowhere. Screwdrivers, then. Off comes the doorhandle &#8211; <em>all right Oliver just a minute</em> &#8211; and I hear the handle on the other side clank to the floor. No access to the mechanism of the lock, not that I&#8217;d know what to do with such access. Probing and digging with screwdrivers and pliers goes nowhere. <em>Just a </em>fucking<em> second Oliver.</em> No amount of hammer violence will loosen the hinge pins. On the stove, the milk boils over.</p>

	<p>I have visions of smashing through frosted glass, of axes splintering wood, of befouled houseplants and inappropriate use of the kitchen sink. I&#8217;m actually standing bent at the waist with half-crossed legs. Like in the movies.</p>

	<p>At last, at the bottom of the toolbox, I find a couple of wood chisels. I decide without conviction that such a door will be <em>easy </em>to repair, just a matter of patching on some laminate really (this sounds good at the time). I apply the tip of the chisel where I estimate the top of the lock mechanism to be and whack it with a hammer. A chunk of laminate the size of my palm comes flying off and <em>click</em> the lock opens and the door swings gently open. A flurry of activity ensues.</p>

	<p>Later in the day I&#8217;m trying to convey my needs to a hardware clerk, who has no problem selling me a new lock mechanism but can&#8217;t quite grasp why chisels and hammers were involved: all I needed to do was slip a credit card between the door and the frame. Like in the movies.</p>
