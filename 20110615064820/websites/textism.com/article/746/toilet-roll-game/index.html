	<h3><a href="http://textism.com/article/746/toilet-roll-game" title="Permanent link to this article">Toilet Roll Game</a> &#183; 28 July 2003</h3>
	<p>The game is best played after a trip to the store.</p>

	<p>Three things to remember when purchasing toilet paper. One, it must not be scented, because no one has ever made a successful go at that. Two, it must be white, or with a subtle pattern on white if plain is unavailable: along with other opinions of the French, Herself is quite vocal in her contempt of their thing for pink asswipe. Mint green is out of the question. Three, &#8216;no such thing as one ply too many&#8217;.</p>

	<p>(A fine time can be had when queueing at the grocery checkout by holding the package of toilet rolls in front of you &#8211; as though, say, presenting it as a gift &#8211; and, with an absolute minimum of arm movement, seeing how close to the ceiling you can get it; ceilings in modern grocery stores are uniformly high, and for that there is a reason. Remember that objects return to the ground with the same momentum with which they went up.)</p>

	<p>Once home, the game can be played after all the other groceries are put away, or before: that has no bearing.</p>

	<p>At our house the toilet rolls are kept next to the toilet, in a basket, right close at hand,  available when one runs out and another is required. Some keep theirs in a cupboard with the towels, under the sink with the cleaning products, or even in a closet down the hall. We prefer the convenience of a basket. For this game, you need to prefer this convenience as well.</p>

	<p>To play, situate yourself with a clear line of sight approximately as far away from your toilet as you can comfortably lob an object the size and heft of a toilet roll. If in doing so you find yourself in the hall or another room, that&#8217;s fine. Open the package of toilet rolls (it should be at least a twelve-pack).</p>

	<p>Take the first toilet roll and put it on the ground, for later.</p>

	<p>Wearing rubber gloves, dip the second into can of flammable gel, squeeze the excess, and place it strategically in the drapes of a Polynesian-themed restaurant like in <cite>Goodfellas.</cite></p>

	<p>Unravel and bunch up part of the third and stick some up each nostril, with quite a bit hanging out, so you can enjoy a bowl of hash like the bridesmaid in <cite>Go.</cite></p>

	<p>Write notes on the fourth in a caffeinated, nervous hand, like Dustin Hoffman in <cite>All the President&#8217;s Men.</cite> Call out that you&#8217;ll be just a minute.</p>

	<p>The fifth will carry a message: a bomb will go off when you get up from the toilet, like the one seen by Danny Glover in <cite>Lethal Weapon.</cite> Good thing you&#8217;re not actually <em>on the toilet</em> then, isn&#8217;t it.</p>

	<p>With the sixth, sew a breast pocket for a lumberjack&#8217;s plaid flannel shirt.</p>

	<p>Stuff most of the seventh up your sleeve. Daub a bit of saliva, and wipe dirty faces.</p>

	<p>While a divorcing couple is in talking to their lawyer, wrap their car in the eighth.</p>

	<p>Send the ninth to Conrad Black, along with a note: &#8216;Thinking of you&#8217;.</p>

	<p>Carry the tenth at dawn across a frosty field behind a country house, in a robe, barefoot.</p>

	<p>Redo Peter Sellers&#8217; bathroom scene in <cite>The Party</cite> with the elevent, but use a vacuum cleaner.</p>

	<p>Lob the twelfth, watch it bounce out of the basket right into the bowl.</p>

	<p>When the toilet paper is gone, ask Tallulah Bankhead if she can spare some. If not, ask if she has two fives for a ten.</p>
