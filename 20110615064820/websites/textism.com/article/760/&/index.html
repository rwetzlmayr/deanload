	<h3><a href="http://textism.com/article/760/oh-debbie" title="Permanent link to this article">Oh Debbie</a> &#183; 27 October 2003</h3>
<p>A single <span class="caps">MP3</span> takes about five times as long to get as it does to play; a system update or a software release will, if you&#8217;re lucky, be there in the morning when you click it before bed; pages built with Flash or sludgy Javascript usually aren&#8217;t worth the bother. Anything urgent means a twenty minute drive to an internet shop where for money one can watch all sorts of copyright violations rain down at a half-gigabyte per hour.</p>

	<p>The digital rural lifestyle, at 56k.</p>

	<p>Some time ago France Telecom announced that every community with a hundred interested broadband subscribers would have <span class="caps">ADSL</span> brought to them. Months later the local <em>mairie</em> snapped into action by putting a petition on its reception desk. But in a village where the median age is about seventy, and where there are probably more tractors than computers, and where no one ever goes to the <em>mairie,</em> there was no mad rush to sign. So no broadband in the near future.</p>

	<p>For ages I tried to get satellite to work, but the rates have always been ridiculous (consumption-wise, analogous to a hundred bucks for a bowl of tapwater), and while Macs could theoretically be configured to negotiate the <span class="caps">VPN</span> moat and drawbridge of satellite broadband, people were happy to point out that no one ever had.</p>

	<p>Now, though, it seems rates are getting more affordable. Packages are on offer that compete in price with terrestrial <span class="caps">DSL</span>, without miserly bandwidth limitations. So I just signed the hell up.</p>

	<p>All very exciting except that now, in order to make it work, and within a day of installing Apple&#8217;s latest and greatest system update, which is marvellous and a pleasure to behold &#8211; though I can&#8217;t figure why they abandoned the pane tabs in dialog boxes &#8211; I have to go out and buy a PC.</p>

	<p>There are other reasons to get one: certain PC-only software won&#8217;t run under emulation,  there&#8217;s always that testing-on-multiple-platforms thing that grownup software developers are always prattling on about, and the kids need a machine with which to go online and do, erm, &#8216;homework&#8217; (there was once a rusty old clamshell iBook available for this purpose, but one day fate put it in the same room as the little red-haired kid, a glass of lemonade, and gravity). But still it feels a bit like hell has frozen over.</p>

	<p>And I have no idea what to look for. I&#8217;d be grateful for help from Windows enthusiasts on the following questions:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Will the Internet Sharing feature in Win2K or XP allow one to connect an Airport base station by ethernet and broadcast internet connections, or will separate routing software be required?</li>
		<li>Other than a hard drive, processor, video card, ethernet and <span class="caps">USB</span>, is there anything I should expect to need in the box?</li>
		<li>What is a reasonable ballpark price for such a box, assembled piecemeal? Monitor? Peripherals?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Thanking you!</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: Lebowski, we&#8217;re getting a Dell. </p>

	<p>Thanks to all who wrote with advice, in particular those who pointed out the glaring truth that components are so inexpensive now that trying to save money by buying second-hand is foolish at best.</p>

	<p>Still, the question of how Dell can manage to undercut the price of everyone else&#8217;s factory machines and still throw in a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and all other bells and whistles besides is a little worrying, no?</p>
