            <p>When shopping for a quality men&#146;s shirt, the Domesticated 
              Male should enter each store informed. Ready to make a purchase. 
              And then get out. No self-respecting male enjoys shopping, and you&#146;re 
              no exception. This is all business, and you&#146;ve got better things 
              to do.</p>
            <p>You already know that looking sharp is a combination of attitude 
              and good grooming, but it&#146;s the shirt that makes the man. As 
              you shop, there are a few things you should look for:</p>
            <ul type="circle">
              <li>100% Cotton (no blends)</li>
              <li>Meticulous single-needle stitching</li>
              <li>Split-back yoke to provide a contoured fit</li>
              <li>Tailored sleeve gauntlets</li>
              <li>Fine stitching and sewn interlinings for crispness and longevity</li>
              <li>Precise and consistent armhole shape</li>
              <li>Cross-stitched buttons</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Check each item off your list as you go. Check them all off and 
              you&#146;ve found your shirt.</p>
            <p>And do yourself a favor: Have your shirt professionally laundered 
              or dry cleaned (as appropriate). Tumbling the thing alongside your 
              filthy gym-socks is no way to make quality clothing last.</p>
            <p>And above all else, wear an undershirt. It absorbs your perspiration 
              and deodorant and increases your shirt&#146;s lifespan. And it will 
              help keep you cooler (despite what you&#146;ve heard). Make the 
              white undershirt a permanent part of your daily uniform without 
              exception, and you&#146;ll never fail.</p>

              oozing and dumb, realize the universe is sort of stunned and appalled 
              and a little jaded by it all, no one quite sure what to do with 
              all the visitors who must be thinking it must be some sort of joke

              this site is often serious and Canada is just shaking its head sadly 
              and saying screw it it&#146;s Friday and taking the rest of the 
              day off to putter around and read a book and maybe getting a nice 
              vodka tonic somewhere with a friend to blow shit up and grumble 
              about OS X because life is just too damn short.</p>
            <p>You know those relatively common-knowledge things you really should 
              know and you probably heard somewhere and are certain must&#146;ve 
              come up in the past and are even something in your general cultural 
              purview? Well, I&#8217;m a Canadian in love and living in France 
              with a beautiful writerly muse with books all around and a Lab and 
              life is grand because I&#8217;m feeling pretty good about exuding 
              confidence and my current state of tumescence. Or at least I did 
              for a period during the hot and tumultuous summer of the third and 
              last Lilith Fair tour, eh? Until I reverted to recursive spin-loops 
              which reminds me to send pictures of my Jetta.</p>
            <p>I&#8217;m petulant and have dreams of ravishing super-skanky chicks 
              and cranking the Skynyrd and sucking wine coolers and smoking menthols, 
              proof that we are constantly reminded by a wry smooth ironic hilarious 
              bone-dry sense of humor and a fabulous eye and gift for poetic imagery, 
              especially when drunk on the iced vodka of time. And, alas, sometimes 
              the best marketing is a chunk of soap and a sock.</p>

            <p>(unaffiliated with George W. Bush, or any existing series for dummies)</p>
            <p>From Chapter 2, How to Start and Build Your Literary Career for 
              Canadians</p>
            <p>&#8212;Do an <span class="caps">MFA</span> and screw your instructor 
              and/or classmates, either literally or figuratively.</p>
            <p>&#8212;Find out what the journal editors write about. If you&#146;re 
              trying to do poetry, this will usually mean rambling on about birds, 
              or engaging in remote, complicated linguistic play that kinda seemed 
              to make sense at the time. If your thing is short stories, try snappy 
              dialogue between bisexual ad execs in seedy bars, or a work about 
              a misunderstood psychic visual artist. In any event, write about 
              the same things everyone else does. Quote the zine editors a lot.</p>
            <p>&#8212;Befriend publishers. Put up with their misogyny and buy 
              them pints of domestic until they offer you a book deal (usually 
              3&#8211;6 months).</p>
            <p>&#8212;After each new book, no matter how ignored by the masses, 
              how panned by the media, how NutraSweet the content, how tapioca 
              the design, you&#146;ll get more government grants. You will also 
              get to read in the seedy bars that will inspire your next oeuvre. 
              There will be hordes of others like yourself there. Read a chapter 
              of their books in the store, then next time you see them, pretend 
              you have actually bought the book. Keep feeding them red herrings 
              like &#147;You really must come by to sign my book&#148;. But do 
              not invite them. Hope that the ruse works and that they buy your 
              memoirs. After all, your opus was reviewed by your &#147;friend&#148; 
              in The Canadian Literary Journal of Under-35-Year-Old Angsty Suburban 
              Writing. When your &#147;friends&#148; become famous they may eventually 
              mention your name to somebody.</p>
            <p>&#8212;Travel as little as possible, so it will be easier to forget 
              that you are unknown outside your own 20 square km. If you must 
              travel, return with pithy prose poems&#8211;cum-aphorisms or very 
              long essays exposing your misinterpretation of local culture. The 
              hoi polloi especially like to read haiku about your all-expenses-paid 
              month in Mazatl&#183;n. The important thing to remember is, <span class="caps">NOBODY 
              BUT YOU HAS EVER SEEN OR THOUGHT THIS BEFORE</span>.</p>
            <p>&#8212;If that fails to get you noticed, write positive reviews 
              of everything. Or bad ones. Keep sleeping with everyone until you 
              get famous vicariously. After a while the fame will stick.</p>
            <p>&#8212;If all else fails, become an academic and write diatribes 
              about what abysmal authors everyone but you and your friends are. 
              You are right.</p>

              Fra&#238;che and Cognac</span> :: FEB 18</p>
            <p><span class="caps">WHAT IT IS</span>: A delicious yet typographically 
              challenging brunch.</p>
            <p><span class="caps">WHY IT IS NEEDED</span>: Attention to detail 
              never tasted so good.</p>
            <p><span class="caps">WHEN TO DO IT</span>: The rare days on which 
              you are not sick, hungover, or both.</p>
            <p>GO: You have motored back from an impossibly quaint village, and 
              you have brought some things with you. Place them on the table. 
              Heavy cream, buttermilk, all-purpose flour, eggs, Cognac: a nice 
              A.E.DOR &#146; Hors d&#146;Age N&#176;6. (Please, none of that Guerb&#233; 
              shit, or at very least, something that was aged in Tier&#231;ons 
              of Limousin oak.) Get out a large bowl, a whisk, a fork, a wooden 
              spoon, and a glass &#150; a big one.</p>
            <p>Now pour yourself three fingers of that Cognac. Take a sip. I said 
              &#147;sip&#148; for chrissake. Okay, sip again.</p>
            <p>Now for the cr&#232;me fra&#238;che. Place 1 cup heavy cream in 
              the bowl then add a 1/4 cup of buttermilk. Imagine how delicious 
              that cute little &#147;&#238;&#148; will look on your web site. 
              Feel the Cognac stirring in your gut. Good. Step out back for a 
              cigarette. Strut, fret, smoke. Note how well the Cognac goes with 
              your Gitanes. Get back inside and refill that glass. Make it four 
              fingers this time.</p>
            <p>Stir the cream and the milk together with a splash of the Cognac. 
              Top up your glass while you&#146;re at it. Stir with vigour. Cover 
              and let sit at room temperature. The appropriate firmness of the 
              cr&#232;me fra&#238;che is gauged by allowing a spoon to stand upright 
              within it. The appropriate amount of Cognac to drink while you wait 
              is gauged by your personal ability to stand upright without it. 
              Run the numbers. Conclude the time it will take to for the mixture 
              to settle exceeds the time it will take to finish the Cognac. Become 
              indignant. Abandon the project.</p>

            <p>In a world where they turn tables as quickly as possible, she allows 
              you to recline, make talk, she encourages <i>languor</i> by her

              at the door while we dined.</p>
            <p>What a spin. Like wondering if Takashi Murakami&#146;s Superflat 
              is an artistic statement about merchandising, or something more 
              tanglible, like, say, <i>actual</i> merchandising. (I&#146;ll wait 
              while you google him). Back? Where were we? Yes, Murakami&#146;s

            <p>I had a text. It arranged itself on the page carefully so as to 
              avoid offending anyone. The word &#8220;Kick it!&#8221; appeared. 
              It had worked its way in from the CD playing upstairs, something 
              from some white rap group. I cringed knowing they were popular.</p>
            <p>I felt it was inappropriate under the circumstances. I tried to 
              erase it. It moved carefully to the right and re-arranged itself 
              into &#8220;Itickc&#8221; which made no sense. I heard laughter.</p>
            <p>&#8220;This is ridiculous!&#8221; I muttered. It was also misspelled. 
              &#8220;This will not due, since it is a pun and not the word I was 
              looking for.&#8221; I was completely confused by the proliferation 
              of text which seemed to copy itself directly onto the page even 
              as I tried to write sensible things, many times the letters had 
              ideas of their own and ran off to copulate and form odd offspring, 
              things like &#8220;trabulatorition&#8221; and &#8220;Thormbolitory&#8221; 
              which I knew were not actual words. &#8220;Thorgslagnatititory&#8221;, 
              &#8220;glomnarbuttocks&#8221;, and &#235;retlaitorattedfram&#8221; 
              followed.</p>
            <p>The term &#8220;malndavitated&#8221; occurred a number of times 
              across the page. &#8220;This is not text this is mere confusion.&#8221; 
              I whispered and chose another text, carefully watching my fingers 
              as they typed the letters and words.</p>

            <p>&#8220;The text mimics the sky which gathers carefully in all weathers 
              attempting to mimic the writer of style. The bombarding eye is lit 
              by the gay gift of vision. Like a field full of flowers repays the 
              loan from the face which hovers nearby. We read the screen this 
              way or is it a typographic page? In quick sweeps the weather guesses 
              the sky like an astronomer in magnified bits. We look to it for 
              clues and it reveals more than wisdom. This makes it an attractive 
              place for advertising and womanizing, but not so good a place.&#8221;</p>

            <p>I was fully aware of the typography and the nuances. I was gratified 
              twice over the typing had gone without any more trouble. I uploaded 
              my web logged wisdom, hearing the wires sing in fury at the mixed 
              metaphors that flowed quickly to my glorious page. &#8220;Unlike 
              any other!&#8221; I smiled and quoted myself in my fruitful mind 
              feeling the letters slice meaning from the night.</p>

            <p>As I sat &#8211; nay, contemplated thoughtfully; who has time for 
              mere sitting? &#8211; and considered the ideal length to which the 
              nascent scrub under my chin, which is masquerading as a &#8220;beard,&#8221; 
              should be permitted to grow (the suggestion made by one impolite 
              reader of the <a href="http://www.canada.com/vancouver/vancouversun/story.asp?id=%7B787C26D4-F7CA-40B7-9202-E96B597223C7%7D">Vancouver 
              Sun Article</a> that I &#8220;put some milk on that so the cat can 
              lick it off&#8221; of course summarily discarded as illiterate chimpery) 
              I heard the sound of Herself in the kitchen putting away the dishes.</p>
            <p>Sneezing once more, and idly scratching my perpetually swollen 
              and agitated genitals, I expelled all considerations of beardedness 
              from my mind, for it had been merely a trifle, and the vastness 
              of my conscious ability had suddenly seized upon a truly great problem, 
              a problem even greater than my eternal search to find the edges 
              of my ego (for to plumb all infinite depths is the duty of true 
              and brilliant minds). The problem I set myself upon, a problem to 
              occupy me in the few free moments between judging the inferiority 
              of other electronic artists to myself, lamenting the current state 
              of Canadian cultural thought (implying, and I admit the obvious 
              paradox, that Canada has a unique culture), posting images of my 
              Oliver, and whining indolence, was this: to find the exact typeface 
              which corresponded most closely to the form of Herself.</p>
            <p>In my mind I keep a library of over 90,000 typefaces, whether inscribed 
              in stone, wood, or bytes. Show me the merest shard of a descender, 
              and I will cry out &#8220;Jansen,&#8221; &#8220;New Century Schoolbook&#8221;, 
              or God forbid, &#8220;Hobo.&#8221; Yet while the catalog is vast, 
              I narrowed it quickly to a few choice specimens. At first I considered 
              she might be most like Sabon &#8211; classic grace and elegance, 
              yet modernized through Tschichold&#8217;s intelligent sense of abstraction 
              &#8211; an intelligence not unlike my own. But her face, I reasoned 
              (and how did I reason, reader! I reasoned so that Carlyle, Kant, 
              and Wittgenstein rose from their graves and faced France.) has the 
              elegance of the lowercase &#8220;g&#8221; of Perpetua. And yet still 
              again her legs are pure sans-serif, as fine as the &#8220;h&#8221; 
              of Frutiger &#8211; the same Frutiger designed, of course, for the 
              signage of a Paris airport, and thus emininently fitting for her 
              current situation.</p>
            <p>Of such great force were my mental processes, churning through 
              typefaces and matching them to her features, that, momentarily, 
              I froze in a total confusion borne of the massive intellectual pressures 
              that occur across the span of my cerebellum. She emerged from the 
              kitchen, having put away the dishes, and her smile gave thaw to 
              my sudden block &#8211; I came out of my state of total concentration 
              with a solution. A lesser mind could not have arrived at the conclusion 
              so readily, I admit, but mine is no lesser mind, and I had found 
              my point of realization: that she was unto herself a typeface most 
              divine, and could not be compared. The contrast of Herself with 
              the slope of Garamond&#8217;s italic descenders was futile, given 
              her substance in the flesh and blood before me. (Although her nose 
              does have a certain shade reminiscent of the &#8220;C&#8221; in 
              Caslon.)</p>
            <p>Ah! Herself, an entire type case could not set a page of your charms!</p>

              <li>Cheesecake is not supposed to be blue. Ever.</li>
              <li>The message of a text must always be reiterated through its 
                container&#8217;s design.</li>
              <li>Station wagons come in handy.</li>
              <li>The French will always be rude to some of their own, and most 
                foreigners.</li>
              <li>Wild rabbits do not care for chocolate.</li>
              <li>Prince Charles may never be King Charles. (Not that I&#8217;m 
                planning anything.)</li>
              <li>As a young man, Matisse learned how to enjoy fruit, boating, 
                and women from Cezanne.</li>
              <li>Robert Altman should never be allowed to step on a soundstage, 
                phone a studio, or imagine himself looking through the lens of 
                a camera, making that odd rectangle with his hands, ever, EVER, 
                again.</li>
              <li>Repair cupboard.</li>
              <li>King may only castle if he and rook have not moved.</li>
              <li>I just can&#8217;t seem, what with all the effort I muster to 
                try, to form an opinion on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_1843000/1843098.stm">Stephen 
                Byers.</a></li>
              <li>A pork ragout is simply impossible without a slight touch of 
                blood orange and a pinch of curry</li>
            </ol>
