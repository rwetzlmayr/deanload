Subject: Images of Attacks Available at Corbis

Corbis' Newsroom (http://tm0.com/corbis) has images of
today's terrorist attacks available for licensing. Corbis Sygma
and Corbis Saba photographers in New York and Washington, DC have
been at the scenes of these attacks from very early on, capturing
the events.

The selection of images at Corbis includes up-to-the moment
pictures from New York and Washington, DC, as well as archival
images on subject such as terrorism, the World Trade Center, the
Pentagon, and other related subjects.

New images and features will continue to come in throughout today
and moving forward, so check back with Corbis' newsroom for new
content.

If you have not used Corbis Newsroom before, you can get immediate
access to the images by calling 1-800-260-0444 to quickly register.


Corbis Offices
Corbis' network of offices around the world continues to operate
today with a few key exceptions in New York City.

Corbis' main office in New York has been closed for the day,
along with the Corbis Stock Market office in New York City. These
offices are far enough away from the scene of today's attack that
they were not directly affected, but due to communications and
transportation issues, as well as a sensitivity to the situation,
they have been closed.

If your normal Corbis contacts are at one of our New York offices,
please call
1-800-260-0444 to reach us. This is Corbis' normal 1-800 number,
and calls that usually go to our New York offices will
automatically be routed to Corbis staff in other locations. Phone
numbers for Corbis' other domestic and international remain the
same.

To contact Corbis Stock Market by phone, please call 1-800-999-0800
as normal.

Corbis Sygma and Corbis Saba offices continue to be open.

Corbis' various web sites continue to operate as normal for
commercial, editorial, business communication and personal imagery.
