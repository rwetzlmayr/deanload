   <description><![CDATA[<p>It goes like this.</p>
<p>Decide you’re ready for a fast prime lens, because much of the time you’re taking pictures in low light and you need the flexibility one would provide.</p>
<p>Discover your Nikon camera doesn’t actually like prime lenses per se, steering you instead toward their own (otherwise very good) line of zoom lenses, which don’t require the on-body focusing motor your Nikon lacks.</p>
<p>Lo! It turns out Sigma makes a fast prime lens with a built-in focusing motor. Just the thing! You buy one secondhand on the Ebay.</p>
<p>It arrives in a timely fashion, you take some shots. You feel vaguely badass, but quickly begin to realise that the subjects are always slightly out of focus. You do some tests, it’s a consistent problem. Lightroom’s develop module mocks and sniggers.</p>
<p>You look around the intershingles, and find you’re not alone; the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=sigma+30mm+%22front+focus%22" title="Google search">problem with this model of lens is rampant</a>, and it seems everyone who buys one rolls the dice to see if they get a dud or not. Those who do, say <em>no problem!</em> because with Sigma’s warranty, you can always return it for recalibration. Yours is still under warranty.</p>
<p>Bah. Fine. You make a farty sound with your lips, and call to consult the one solitary Sigma technician in France, who says, <em>yeah, send it in with the warranty card, I’ll get it back to you in a couple weeks.</em> Fine, off to the post office with you.</p>
<p>Two weeks do indeed go by, at which point an ‘estimate for repair’ arrives by mail, on which there is a sum named. The sum is about half what you paid for the lens. You speak some salty language and pick up the phone.</p>
<p><span class="caps">—WTF</span>, one solitary Sigma technician in France?<br />—It’s not covered.<br />—The hell you say!<br />—It’s not covered. It wasn’t imported into the EU.<br />—I did import it into the EU.<br />—Not through customs. It’s only imported when it goes through customs.<br />—Of course it went through customs! They look at everything that comes by courier.<br />—They didn’t look at yours, so it’s not covered.<br />—But the guy who sold it to me got rid of it because <em>it wasn’t sharp.</em> It’s a defective lens! You have to be aware of the problem!<br />—It’s not covered.<br />—I hate you and your mother is in army shorts.</p>
<p>A few years ago there were G5 iMacs that were randomly turning off power, <em>poof,</em> and Apple sent out notice acknowledging the problem, announcing it would be repaired on all iMacs, in or out of warranty. Sigma, however, doesn’t have any evident problem with sending dud products out at a premium price, only to service those customers who bother to complain.</p>
<p>And then there’s you, in your freaky little bureaucratic niche of ‘Worldwide warranty’ non-coverage, with a lens that was defective at manufacture, being asked to pay the price to fix it. If someone from Sigma has anything to say on the matter – perhaps a way to see this whiny consumer rant have a happy ending – you can be reached at dean@textism.com.</p>]]></description>

   <author>dean@textism.com (Dean Allen)</author>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>I wrote a <a href="http://textism.com/2008/04/24/podswollop" title="Podswollop"><span style="color: #a90000;">thingy</span></a> on the podcasting format a couple months ago – making fun of novelty gadgets and mediocrity, but also listing shows I subscribe to and like. Within an hour or so of posting it my Apache logs showed a flurry of visits from public radio employees (*.wnyc.org, etc.) so dense that one could be forgiven for suspecting that any mention on the web of the fine work they do sets off bells and whistles in otherwise silent offices; a couple emails announcing I was now on the mailing list for programmes I’d mentioned; and one direct email from Jesse Thorn, host of the PRI-distributed <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">The Sound of Young America</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I bet you would like my show.<br /> You should give it a listen sometime.<br /> Jesse</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time I hadn’t heard or even heard of it, but was thrilled to bits that the <em>host</em> of an <em>American public radio show</em> would take the time to write. I immediately subscribed it into iTunes, listened to ten minutes of the first download, said <em>meh</em> out loud (winking and referring to yourself as ‘America’s radio sweetheart’ is charming once, annoying the second time, and on the third, oh boy pal, you better start delivering some muthafuckin’ <span class="caps">RADIO</span> over here) and closed – but luckily did not delete – the <span class="caps">TSOYA</span> folder.</p>
<p>Turns out that, in a completely unprecedented turn of events, I was impatient and quick to dismiss. I listened to some more shows, and gradually got into the interviewing style, which is at once relaxed and expectantly perched, like a first date in which only one person has been somewhat briefed on the other, but both eventually hit a sort of groove. Compared, say, to Terry Gross on <em>Fresh Air,</em> who seems to make a point of trying to know more about the guest’s work than the guest does – resulting in informative if rather dry swordplay – it’s a good deal more organic and fun, which is of course the point. Maximum fun.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">XML</span> feed for the <span class="caps">TSOYA</span> podcast listed episodes going way back into 2007, so over time I’ve been gradually picking and choosing shows (go <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/archive.htm" title="TSOYA Archive">take a spin</a>, there’s lots of there, there), all the while keeping an eye on one near the bottom of the list: ‘<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2007/12/podcast-live-in-chicago-steve-albini.html" title="Steve Albini recorded live in Chicago">Steve Albini</a>, recorded live at Chicago’s Second City Theater’, an episode from last December.</p>
<p>Those not familiar with the musician and recording engineer Steve Albini would do well to start at his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_albini">Wikipedia page</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Steve_Albini%27s_recording_projects">partial list of recording</a> projects. From my perspective, he’s responsible for what is easily the best <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/hitsville/pander.html" title="from 1994">angry letter to a lazy music critic</a> ever, the most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_About_Fucking" title="Big Black: Songs About Fucking">listened album</a> of my early adulthood, and perhaps the greatest screed of all time against the music industry, <a href="http://www.arancidamoeba.com/mrr/problemwithmusic.html">The Problem With Music,</a> a document of such boundless importance that it should be mandatory reading for anyone with dreams of a recording contract. He’s an angry little dork, but thank God above he’s <em>our</em> angry little dork; would that every engineer with a penchant for difficult music had such forceful prose lying around, waiting for something bloated to attack and deflate.</p>
<p>So after saving the podcast interview with Albini for a couple months, like a treat to be awarded whenever I got around to remembering it was still there, I listened to it yesterday. I’d never experienced him being interviewed off the page before, and it really is a treat: you’re struck by how he wanders around in his own analogies, never straying far from the point and remaining engaged with interviewer and audience. <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2007/12/podcast-live-in-chicago-steve-albini.html">Listen to the whole thing</a>, but here are some choice bits I pulled out, because it’s easy to do that and because I care.</p>
<p>Having compared the overproduction of music to sleeping with a woman put together by consultants:</p>

<p>I couldn’t agree more with the following; it has to be said that a lot of the grumbling from musicians about disappearing revenue models is really about disappearing .001% chances of being screwed by an industry, and disappearing .00001% chances of being stadium rich from it:</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s funny how many people, on learning that I’m Canadian, presume I must therefore have an opinion on Glenn Gould. As it happens I do, but the likelihood of any Canadian having one is up there with, I don’t know, a Russian with something to say about Yakov Smirnoff; as accomplished individuals it’s not easy to compare the two, though at least Glenn Gould was funny.</p>
<p>Gould died in 1984, at fifty years old. I was eighteen at the time, and as a typical CBC-listening <em>Globe and Mail-</em>reading pseud I understood then that the condensed mythology of his life formed three distinct acts: the young, fine-boned, freakishly talented pianist who could read music before text, who wrapped himself in sweaters and gloves even in hot weather, whose childhood back injury led him to prefer playing, no matter the setting, seated on a low, crudely homemade <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:DSC01149.JPG">chair</a>; the eccentric adult superstar, touring and recording fuelled by a battery of pharmaceuticals, the first concert pianist to eschew formal dress when playing before an audience, driving recording engineers insane because he couldn’t/wouldn’t stop singing along when he played; and finally, the mature Gould, who at age of thirty-two told the concert music establishment in essence to go fuck itself, and happily never performed in public again. His reasons to stop were many and varied, but you can’t help but admire this sort of clear-headed defiance toward being forced to create on someone else’s terms; like how Artie Shaw – another musician whose talent and hard work earned him the right to lead a bullshit-free career – used to revel in taking unannounced sabbaticals for years at a time at the height of his fame, just to spite those making money off of his work.</p>
<p>It’s that last act – the eighteen years leading up to Gould’s death – where academics and critics do most of their forensic work, and rightly so: having been set free from ownership by promoters, executives and the really rather bizarre celebrity system of concert music, he dabbled to great result in writing and broadcasting, the very best of the latter is found in three radio documentaries for the <span class="caps">CBC</span> which came to be known as <em>T</em><em>he Solitude Trilogy</em> (an excerpt from the first, <em>The Idea of North,</em> is available <a href="http://archives.cbc.ca/arts_entertainment/music/topics/320-1709/">here</a>). For the former, look no further than Tim Page’s excellent volume <em>The Glenn Gould Reader.</em></p>
<p>Probably the most famous piece in that book is a quick ditty Gould wrote for <em>High Fidelity</em> magazine in 1974, ‘<a href="http://collectionscanada.ca/glenngould/028010-502.7-e.html">Glenn Gould Interviews Glenn Gould about Glenn Gould</a>’. While very funny and verbally dextrous, I’m always struck how beautifully Gould, in this pre-postmod meta-<em>meta</em> interview, scores a direct hit on the culture industry he so loathed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>G.G.: Well then, I’ll try to answer likewise. It seems to me that if we’re going to get waylaid by the numbers game, I’ll have to plump for a zero-to-one relationship as between audience and artist, and that’s where the moral objection comes in.</p>
<p>g.g.: I’m afraid I don’t quite grasp that point, Mr. Gould. Do you want to run it through again?</p>
<p>G.G.: I simply feel that the artist should be granted, both for his sake and for that of his public – and let me get on record right now the fact that I’m not at all happy with words like ‘public’ and ‘artist’; I’m not happy with the hierarchical implications of that kind of terminology – that he should be granted anonymity. He should be permitted to operate in secret, as it were, unconcerned with – or, better still, unaware of – the presumed demands of the marketplace – which demands, given sufficient indifference on the part of a sufficient number of artists, will simply disappear. And given their disappearance, the artist will then abandon his false sense of ‘public’ responsibility, and his ‘public’ will relinquish its role of servile dependency.</p>
<p>g.g.: And never the twain shall meet, I daresay!</p>
<p>G.G.: No, they’ll make contact, but on an altogether more meaningful level…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What an enormous pity he didn’t live another twenty years.</p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[On pie]]></title>
   <author>dean@textism.com (Dean Allen)</author>
   <link>http://textism.com/2008/06/10/on.pie</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>As with, say, tea, or American independent cinema, pizza is something the French consume a great deal of, yet understand not at all. Down here in the bottom of the country it’s inescapable, not just from restaurants and freezer sections, but from a hundred thousand or so roadside caravan vendors whose signage always brags of a wood-burning oven (every time I see this, the idea of open wood flame in a fuelled vehicle gives me a start, but then I’m a <em>delicate</em> little flower). What you usually get is a wafer of hardtack barely supporting something extraordinarily oily (which is in turn kicked up a notch via dollops of flavoured oil from a spouted bottle known colloqually as a <em>pipioli,</em> a homonym for <em>pipi au lit:</em> bedwetting); there are lots of nasty variations involving half-cooked lardons, anchovies, but I suppose the ultimate ubiquitous example is rounds of sour cheap chèvre and four eye-crossingly salty-sour snots of unstoned olives ‘à la grecque’.</p>
<p><span class="outright">Very pleasing to see it <a href="http://www.bellapizza.ca/">still exists.</a></span></p>
<p>As a child my definition of a good pie was one made at Bella Pizza in Vancouver because, as a child, any discussion of the subtleties of dining will always be drowned out by a massive salty-sweet wodge of starch and cheese. Bacon, pineapple, beef, sausage: pile it on. What I remember most is the incredible sledgehammer flavours of salty bread and intense tomato sauce, and of course all the great and glorious cheesy grease. I think if I ate such a thing now it would taste great, but my body would stage a small, noisy revolt lasting several unpleasant days. <em>Delicate</em> little flower.</p>
<p>I lean therefore much more now to the opposite side of the pizza spectrum, the best examples of which I’ve had in the US, in restaurants where the mission seems to be to out-Italian the Italians with excellent wood-oven pizzas, focusing on the importance of the crust itself, and on simple, minimal toppings, rather than the mountain of greasy kid stuff which may be piled on top.</p>
<p><span class="outright">I’m not going to get into the whole thin-crust vs thick-crust balderhooch, though I’m sorry, that Chicago thing is fucked up.</span></p>
<p>The mission for the past few years here in hicksville France has been to duplicate that, which is ordinarily only ever done in 60–90 seconds on the stone floor of a 600° C wood-fired oven, using dough meticulously prepared by people who do nothing but prepare pizza dough.</p>
<p>A couple years of research and eight hundred failed experiments flew by, as I gradually learned that good bread and good pizza dough start with the same ingredients: hard, high-protein flour, yeast, salt, sugar, water. More important, though, are the steps during which these are kneaded and rested: dough can’t ever develop a good complex flavour if, as a baking book would advise, it’s simply left to rise in a warm place for a few hours. All the complex chemistry that goes on between yeast and gluten has to happen very slowly, in very controlled temperatures, ideally under the watchful eye of people who do it for a living. Bakers.</p>
<p>So after a lot of bad pizza, I finally started asking the girl behind the counter at the boulangerie to sell me some of their basic white bread dough, which they store frozen in little 300g <em>boules</em> (in math that makes no industrial sense to me whatsoever, three boules make up two baguettes). This dough has been expertly kneaded, albeit by machine, and left to rest until absolutely developed enough to go in the oven. With these, the road to quite good homemade pizza is actually quite short: you let them rise once on the counter, roll or tug or twirl or do whatever you like to the diameter and thinness you desire, and then you do the one thing that pizza cannot be pizza without, you slather the fuck out of it with olive oil. Salt and pepper, and then whatever you like on top. Dough issue solved, and all it requires is the effort to walk in a shop.</p>
<p>Now the other problem is of course heat – nothing you can do at home (short of building a stoked woodburning oven) will ever approximate the furnace of a stoked woodburning oven, the intense heat of which makes the crust knock-hard on the outside and chewy, pull-apart tender on the inside. You can get close, however, using a good heat-absorbent pizza stone in a convection oven. I’ve read people say a cheap quarry tile from a hardware store is all you need, but I haven’t found anything better than the (yea, I know they’re the Microsoft of barbecue technology) Weber pizza stone, which they very grandly announce on the packaging to be quarried from select South American soapstone reserves. True or not, when left in an oven set to max (250° C hereabouts) for an hour, it does an amazing job staying hot, which is what you need for the knockable, fully cooked crust and nicely melted whatevers on top. Of course you won’t get results in 60 seconds, but about six and a half minutes should do the trick. You don’t get the lurvly charred, smoky flavour of a wood oven, of course, but no matter. It’s good pizza.</p>
<p class="photo"><img src="http://textism.com/img/pizza1.jpg" alt="Pizza" width="800" height="537" /></p>
<p>This is how I like it, just salt, pepper, tomato coulis, little basil and thyme, some finely (like seethrough) sliced red onion, and fresh mozzarella. Particularly good the next day for breakfast.</p>
<p>Awhile ago, on a nostalgia lark, we did one with chunks of pineapple and the other multi-year project, homemade bacon, of which more later.</p>
<h4>Incidentally</h4>
<p>Oliver is continuing to recover nicely; our heartfelt thanks for all the concern and best wishes. We truly appreciate it.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>(You’ll need to be a dog person to get through this.)</p>
<p>When Oliver was <a href="http://textism.com/article/750/">struck</a> with the canine horrorshow that is Volvulus – in which a dog’s stomach flips and ties off at both ends – almost five years ago, the shock and aftershock of just how immediate the problem was never wore off. We were lucky that everything worked out, but in the time since two constants have remained: my awe at the patient competence of the vets who treated the problem that Sunday night, and my inability to stop looking at my dog as ready to expire at any second. This manifests itself in a sort of manic parental over-protectiveness, the irritating qualities of which Herself has no trouble pointing out. I find this irritating in turn.</p>
<p>Anyway, barring some <a href="http://textism.com/oliver/daily/2006/03/09">unpleasantness</a> with a stick in early 2006 and the occasional cut and bruise, Oliver’s been fine the past five years. And then on Friday morning we woke to find that after seven years of pretty reliable house-training he had, shall we say, let one drop in the bedroom. He spent the morning walking around hunched over, moaning through his nose and generally looking supremely pissed off. Didn’t want to eat or drink, and out on the walk he just kept straining his hindquarters and turning around to point us back home.</p>
<p>I knew it couldn’t be Volvulus again, because his stomach wasn’t swollen, and assumed that, since his digestive system was clearly working, there must be something working its way through, probably something he’d found in the garbage, happens all the time. Anyone can be both overprotective and blasé about what can and will pass through a dog. Here’s me <a href="http://twitter.com/textism/statuses/828469018">cracking wise like an idiot</a> about it as it happened.</p>
<p>To be sure, we went to see the vet in town, an experience that always delivers the odd, first because <em>no one else is ever there</em> and because he and his wife/assistant both have crazy <em>crazy</em> eyes. He did a quick once-over, said Oliver’s temperature was up, but no visible problems with his prostate or digestive system, and agreed wholeheartedly that there was just something slowly making its way through. Call me later.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon there was a bounceback; Oliver got all energetic again, seemed to want to eat, drank some water. Whew, in the clear. And then through the night he got worse. And worse. In the morning we went into the vet, who still looked stymied, but finally suggested we go see the other vet in town (there was another vet?) for an ultrasound. Calls were made, previously administered medicines communicated, off we went.</p>
<p>Holy Fuck, it was like finding a vast library hidden behind a comic book store. The place was booming with women carrying cats in cages (though, it became clear, most were there just to flirt and bat eyes at the Self-Styled Renaissance Vet with whom we were about to meet).</p>
<p>Self-Styled Renaissance Vet whisked us in to a massive gleaming exam room, sort of a shrine to himself and his love for animals, his published volumes of poetry and philosophy, his degrees in artificial insemination and (I’m not kidding) tortoise surgery, and his <span class="caps">INEVITABLE</span> rumpled rugged good looks. We told him what the other vet’s opinions were, to which he sort of politely rolled his eyes, as though clearing up the other guy’s mistakes is part of his daily routine, and, giving Oliver a quick look over, reported how grave the situation clearly was, and that thinking an animal this dehydrated, in this much pain, was merely passing something awkward would be a fatal mistake. I decided we had a new vet. We left Oliver there at his clinic, and last night we waited, got a couple courteous update phonecalls, and goofed around with Hugo, who was amazed at his sudden status as top dog in the house.</p>
<p>The crux of this story is that the (now ex-) vet was able to say, with confidence, that there was nothing wrong with Oliver’s prostate. The (now) vet informed us this morning that the <span class="caps">ENTIRE</span> <span class="caps">PROBLEM</span> was a severe prostate infection, which had, by the time we arrived there, already led to peritonitis and the beginnings of blood sepsis, which is just about as urgent and dangerous as it gets. Overnight they’d treated it with such speed and skill we were able to pick him up today, and he’s now home, with prescriptions for a two-month course of treatment, but should be fine. I am exhausted.</p>
<p>And how was your weekend.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>So much to <em>do</em> these days. I keep forgetting to direct my great Zeus-like gaze of approval to David Friedman’s site <a href="http://ironicsans.com">Ironic Sans</a>, which you may recall made a very loud splash a couple years ago with the first of what would be many ‘ideas’ proposed on the site, <a href="http://www.ironicsans.com/2006/03/idea_prepixelated_clothes_for_1.html">pre-pixelated clothes for Reality TV shows</a>. I remember thinking at the time that, as ideas go, ‘that’s fucking brilliant’. The site is relentless if measured fun, and as you click around you find out things like he’s a cleverly stylish professional <a href="http://www.davidfriedmanphoto.com/people/index.html">photographer</a>, who also writes a mean <a href="http://www.davidfriedmanphoto.com/about.html">about page</a>.</p>
<p><span class="outright">And hey, he just <a href="http://textism.com/favrd/favorites/person/ironicsans">turned up</a> on Favrd.</span></p>
<p>Anyway to me one of the best things about Ironic Sans is the utterly compelling collection of short videos of otherwise unremarkable things, <a href="http://www.ironicsans.com/60_seconds/">60 Seconds</a>, the latest of which, <a href="http://www.ironicsans.com/2008/05/60_seconds_in_the_life_of_comm.html">60 Seconds in the Lives of Commuters</a>, just made coffee shoot out of my nose.</p>
<p>In a sort of homage to David’s project, in no way at all connected to being desperate to do something stupid with a new Flip camera, may I present 60 Seconds in the Life of an Armchair, 12 Seconds After I Leave the Room.</p>
