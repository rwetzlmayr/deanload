              Real innovation in design, or any other field, happens in context. 
              That context is usually some form of cooperatively managed enterprise. 
              Frank Gehry, for instance, is only able to realize Bilbao because 
              his studio can deliver it on budget. The myth of a split between 
              &#8220;creatives&#8221; and &#8220;suits&#8221; is what Leonard 
              Cohen calls a &#8216;charming artifact of the past.&#8217; </p></td>
