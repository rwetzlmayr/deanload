  	<p>As the recent parent of a runaway pet, I felt your pain. Mrs. Beasley, my aloof, grand-dame-of-a-dog (actually a cat trapped in a dog’s body) disappeared on a recent walk in the woods. I had to go teach night school, so after calling and calling, I took my other two dogs home and dashed to work. <br />

<br />

Two hours later the police appeared at school with the phone number of the elderly basset hound owner who had taken her in. Seems she had spent the evening on this woman’s sofa, eating tidbits and having her belly rubbed while my imagination had her dying several times over.<br />

<br />

She was delivered to me in a <span class="caps">BMW</span>, and to make it even worse, when they pulled up she gave me one of her famous Betty Davis glares of distain, was not eager to get out of the car, and had to be lured out with a treat, which made it obvious to her rescuer that I was a monster who should not be allowed to have dogs. <br />

<br />

Her majesty was carted home where she got her nightly egg and slept on the bed, under the covers, just how she likes it. She has made it clear that we won’t speak of the incident again.</p>

  	<p>How are you doing the date-based archives? With a plugin? Or is this an RC feature?</p>

  	<p>Tom, it’s something I’m trying to introduce into the Txp core. This was only a 1-line hack to publish.php and a mod_rewrite rule, but I’m also trying out a couple other methods.</p>

  	<p>Dearest Dean and Gail. <br />

We have it on the best authority that your Mum and Peter are on her way to visit you. If they are afforded anything near the hospitallity we were you will have trouble forcing them to leave. We are of course rain forest green with envy.  Love to all, Dad</p>
