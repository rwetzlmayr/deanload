  	<p>Wow! I hope that ruler is showing centimetres, not inches! Poor Oliver – but he’s doing a fabulous job of carrying off that scarf – very Audrey Hepburn, Ollie.</p>

  	<p>YIPES! Was that related to the “um… drained gland?” <br />

<br />

Ya know, sometimes ya’  just can’t trust them there doggies… they get obstructions from greenies & tennis balls, choke on rawhides, get teeth caught on buddy’s collar and (nearly) strangle buddy, wolf down entire rolls of paper toweling, and stuff themselves on polyfill pillows. What the heck would they do without us? I’ve heard it’s part of a conspiracy between dogs & vets but I dunno…..</p>

  	<p>Oh poor lad – glad your vet has finally found it and it’s out of his throat.  I must say he is looking very resigned and dignified about his ordeal at the vets.  Hugo will be wanting a trendy scarf too  !! Hope you have pet insurance !!!!</p>

  	<p>ps.  explain to <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> that <span class="caps">JAVELINS</span> are for throwing and that the sharp end goes forward – less chance of getting impaled that way !!</p>

  	<p>Whew.  Thought it was bad when my Fritz got a pencil stuck up on the roof of his mouth, between his jaw, but this looks <span class="caps">AWFULLY</span> painful.  Hugs and scritches to Oliver, who looks stoic but relieved.</p>

  <div class="comment">
  	<p>OW poor Oliver.  The poodles here advise that he get just a few special small treats to aide in recovery. Their suggestions are fries, cheese pizza bites and a choice bit of bacon.</p>

  	<p>Bless his heart and yours. He waas suffering and couldn’t give you details, and you were suffering because he was suffering.<br />

<br />

At least he looks very cosmopolitan and chic in that scarf.</p>

  	<p>Oli Oli !  Poor lad !  Hey y’all—unless it’s a weird inch-ruler, it’s centimeters.  Those are tenths, not sixteenths.  Bravi to Dean’n’Gail for getting Oli relieved of the big splinter !</p>

  	<p>At least he didn’t swallow two corn cobs (whole) that you didn’t find out about until about a month later when it caused a terrible illness and a very expensive surgery!!! Weims and boxers – kindred spirits.</p>

  	<p>OMG! I hope my dog never “eats” something like that. <br />

How awful for him. Is he trying the Jude Law look with the sash? Maybe he heard he can score a nanny with that look! ;)<br />

Hope he recovers quickly…</p>
