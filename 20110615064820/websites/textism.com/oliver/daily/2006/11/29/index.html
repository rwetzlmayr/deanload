  <div class="comment">
  	<p><span class="caps">OLIVER</span> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by his brother on the bank and of having nothing to do: once or twice he had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Oliver, “without pictures or conversations?’<br />

<br />

So he was considering, in his own mind (as well as he could, for the hot day made him feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.<br />

<br />

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Oliver think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!” (when he thought it over afterwards it occurred to him that he ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but, when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Oliver started to his feet, for it flashed across his mind that he had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, he ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.<br />

<br />

In another moment down went Oliver after it, never once considering how in the world he was to get out again. <br />

<br />

etc….</p>
