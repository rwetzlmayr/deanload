  	<p>Oh dear!  Yes, any time there is non productive vomiting or non produtive pottying, that is a sign of something seriously wrong.  Thank goodness Former Vet admitted his shortcomings diagnosically and sent the Big Guy to Dr. Dreamy.  And lucky that Oliver has 9 lives.  We love you Ollie!</p>

  	<p>Thanks goodness for the new vet!<br />
Weimies don&#8217;t have a corner on scaring their owners half-to-death. Seems it&#8217;s part of the Universal K9 code of conduct. <br />
Tons of empathy to Dean & Herself.<br />
Loads of hugs and skritches to Oliver.</p>

  	<p>Hugs to Dean and Herself; please become  missionaries guiding others to the New Vet.  With your efforts, eventually the incompetent fool (your Ex-Vet) will simply go out of business and open a hardware store, which is where he belongs.</p>

	<p>Looks like it&#8217;s better to spend more on vet visits when there is any type of concern, than to take a &#8216;watch and wait&#8217; attitude, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

	<p>Thanks for &#8216;Daily Oliver.&#8217;  It&#8217;s been a source of pleasure to me for many years now.  <br />

  	<p>When my Weim was a youngster, she suffered a traumatic experience with an incompetent, insensitive vet. I&#8217;ve never forgiven myself for it.</p>

	<p>We left her with him for a very minor op (which I now suspect was unnecessary). He didn&#8217;t sedate her before we left, which I had misgivings about &#8211; but not enough so.</p>

	<p>A couple of hours or so later, there was a call from the vet to come and collect her urgently. She&#8217;d become extremely distressed, got loose from the kennel after the op and in their efforts to restrain her, one of the vets had been bitten (in retrospect, I was glad about this &#8211; the twat deserved it. I hope it hurt. A lot).</p>

	<p>My dog would never bite unless provoked to the extreme or, as was clearly the case, she must have been terrified. When we picked her up, she was absolutely distraught and I felt guilty as hell. I&#8217;ll never know exactly what went on that day but she&#8217;s never forgotten it. She&#8217;s a very confident, well-balanced, well behaved dog but she crumbles whenever we make a visit to our present vet who is totally professional and has the most sympathetic of staff around him who care not just for the animals but their owners equally.</p>

	<p>A hard lesson learned. I&#8217;m so sorry that Dean and his family and Weims have gone through a similar experience.</p>

	<p>Hopefully, Oli will make a full recovery and no damage done. After that, I&#8217;d certainly be making a visit to Mr Incompetent Vet <span class="caps">MRCVS</span> to give him a piece of my mind &#8211; something else I wish I&#8217;d done.</p>

	<p>Hugs & best wishes to you all.</p>

  	<p>We are so sad to hear of Sir Oliver&#8217;s troubles.  Rest assured that me and my team of weimie-lovers are furiously knitting warm blankets, pillows, and poultices made from various pork products, and will be sending them out to you shortly!</p>

  	<p>Thank god for vets in modernity!  I&#8217;m so thrilled that Oliver is on the way to recovery.  The day isn&#8217;t complete until I&#8217;ve seen the daily O!</p>

  	<p>Be well, Oliver. It&#8217;s funny how a dog one has never met can elicit worry! </p>

  	<p>Oh poor Oliver! And you and Herself &#8230;sounds like a rubbish weekend (apart from Hugo&#8217;s brief reign as TD). My Weimie had good care when he was traumatically injured in a <span class="caps">RTA</span> at the age of 16 weeks (and has the contract rear leg to prove it) ...but my parents and mother in law all died prematurely because of incompetent medical &#8216;diagnosis&#8217; so I kind of have an idea how you might have felt &#8211; except of course dogs &#8211; even weimies &#8211; can&#8217;t talk which rather makes the experience a bit worse in some ways.</p>

	<p>Fingers and paws crossed here for a full recovery ..we love Oliver in this house!</p>

  	<p>Oh my! I&#8217;m so glad it all got sorted out and I hope Oliver&#8217;s convalescence is short. I hope you get some rest now he&#8217;s home.</p>

  	<p>What a scare for all.  Please, a scratch behind the ears for the Big Guy.  My day would not be the same without you and your brother.</p>

  	<p>So glad he is okay!!! You have my sympathy as we went through it all last year. Our diagnosis was not caught in time, but we rescued another and pain has faded a bit.  Way to go new vet! </p>
