<h3>About the Daily Oliver</h3>

<p>Each day since 30 June 2002, this page has displayed a different photograph of my dog, Oliver. The image is updated at midnight <span class="caps">GMT</span>, unless I&#8217;ve forgotten to put one up the night before, which does sometimes happen.</p>

<p>A pedigreed Weimaraner, Oliver was born 30 July 2001 on a lavender farm in Le Vaucluse, Provence. He came to join us two months later. You&#8217;d like him.</p>

<p>Also appearing regularly is Oliver&#8217;s little brother Hugo (same parents, different litter), who arrived on 12 April 2003. </p>
