	<h2><span class="gray">About</span> <a href="/oliver/daily/">Oliver, Daily</a></h2>

	<p><span style="font-size:40px">This</span> <span style="font-size:30px">site</span> <span style="font-size:26px">was</span> <span style="font-size:20px">born</span> <span style="font-size:18px">on</span> 30 June, 2002. Since that date 2,109 images have been posted of my dog, Oliver, and/or his brother Hugo, two Weimaraners living with my girlfriend and me in the Rhône valley in southern  France. Note that Oliver is referred to as ‘my dog’ and Hugo as ‘his brother’:  Oliver came first, and as such retains preferred son status, while Hugo not only arrived later, he can sometimes be a <em>total prick.</em></p>

	<p>Born on a lavender farm near Sault, in the Vaucluse department of Provence, Oliver and Hugo have their pedigree papers (whereon they are Siam du Pays des Lavandes and Ugo du Pays des Lavandes, respectively), and apparently both descend from a line of champion show and working <i>braques de weimar à poil court.</i>  While the boys have never shown in any competitive way, and they’ve certainly never worked, one wonders if these so-called champion forebears can claim a couple million page views on a web site just about <em>them.</em> Hmm? I think not.</p>

	<p>Let me answer some questions. Oliver is the thinner, less goofy one, with a black mole near his left eye. Oliver is, uh, intact, Hugo is not. Further comparison can be found on <a href="http://textism.com/photos/?s=48" title="Textism: Photos: Telling the Dogs Apart" class="red"> this ancient document</a>. Oliver is quite calm, whereas Hugo, a minibus on feet, has the energy, enthusiasm and attention span of a child filled with sugar. Oliver will not chase a frisbee, Hugo will not chase a thrown ball. Neither are enormously bright, but Hugo does have something of an edge when it comes to learning things. During a game of fetch, Oliver will find it difficult to give up a tennis ball because, the instant he drops it to the ground, he sees it and goes, ‘hey, a ball!’, and snaps it up again. Hugo will roll over on command, but it’s a rather noisy, sloppy affair and will only happen if it is confirmed in advance there will be something to eat.</p>

	<p>Never having been much good at doing things in a consistent way over time, I should say it’s both astonishing and pleasing the project has gone on as long as it has.</p>

	<p>Anyway, the site is of course free of charge to use, and presented ‘as is’, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, and so on. Copyright remains mine, though, so don’t steal or I’ll punch you in the heart.</p>
