<h3><span class="outleft">25 Apr 2008, 5pm</span></h3>
		
<p>I am as they say hereabouts <em>nul</em> when it comes to taking photographs. As a designer slash art director I think I had a fairly good eye for what makes a picture work, and what makes one work in a layout – at least I hope so, wouldn’t want those thousands of hours spent squinting into loupes over light tables saying <em>nope nope nope</em> to have amounted to nothing. When it comes to taking the things myself though, always a frustration. Press the shutter release, hope for the best, and never ever end up with what was expected (well, maybe <a href="http://textism.com/photos/?s=8&amp;p=75" title="Bad Dog">once</a>). Not entirely unversed in the logic of exposure time and apertures, but ultimately just too impatient to develop anything like the supple knowledge photographers whose work I like can access in an instant. That and I’ve been using the wrong goddamn cameras.</p>
<p>For years now I’ve used Leica (or more often the Panasonic Lumix versions, which have the same glass and electronics but come much cheaper) consumer-end cameras, mainly because some lingering art school snobbery I picked up as a teenager dictates that anything Leica or Hasselblad marks you as a better photographer than any Japanese silliness ever possibly could. True or not (not) the pictures kept turning out wrong: impossible to get a good white balance in anything other than direct sunlight, noisy junk all over the place at any speed greater than 100 <span class="caps">ASA</span>, slippery autofocus that took, like, a couple <em>hours</em> to lock in before firing the shutter. Finally it dawned on me after a few years of blind brand allegiance what Leica’s consumer products are: a brilliant, razor-sharp lens up front, a webcam on back.</p>
<p>I’ve always been reluctant to use a <span class="caps">DSLR</span> – the one sure thing about being an expat is you never want to look like a tourist – however having just this week received a lump sum payment that has at long last made its way through the barely perceptible movements of the rusty squeaking gears that is accounts payable at a certain publishing concern that shall remain, er, unnamed, I did two capricious things I’d been champing at the bit to do for ages: bought Herself (who is, justifiably, more than a little tired of being given my smoked and smudged hand-me-downs) a bright shiny white portable computing device, and myself a Nikon D60, with the standard vanilla 18–55mm kit lens. After all I’m now at the stage in life where, looks-wise, coming off as a tourist occupies the least of my concern.</p>
<p class="photo"><img src="/img/first_fly_20080425_075236_sm.jpg" alt="Photo of the first spring fly spotted this year" width="800" height="537" /></p>
<p><span class="outleft">First fly spotted this year. Many billions more will come.</span></p>
<p>Christ on a <em>bike</em> what a difference. I feel like someone handed a slice of hot toast spread with cultured butter after a lifetime breakfasting on Skittles and government cheese. I mean, it does what I want it to! It autofocuses in less time than it takes my eyes to imagine what a proper focus would be! You can take pictures in tungsten light without tacking a fucking white card to the wall and metering fifteen times! You push the button and it takes a fucking picture! I am in consumer ecstasy! I am in consumer ecstasy! NyQuil! Advil! Malt liquor! </p>
<p>Ahem. Gonna go take pictures of my feet.</p>

<h3><span class="outleft">24 Apr 2008, 12pm</span></h3>
		
<p>Alright, here’s another item about a well-established phenomenon that everyone has already commented the bejaysus out of, but I’ve decided it’s my turn so deal.</p>
<p>Back in the day, by the time Winer (is there anything Dave Winer doesn’t claim to have invented?) and Curry were at mortal combat over who came up with the podcast, the format already had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_law">Sturgeon’s Law</a> so firmly applied that the time requirements and relatively laborious process of trying one out just to see if you like it were plainly unworthy of the effort. One morning, so it seemed, there it was: an ocean of audio to choose from, and any programmatic or communo-Darwinian attempts to filter out quality failed or dried up in no time. Sure, if you’re the sort of person who takes <em>Lost</em> seriously, you’re going to listen to a <em>Lost</em> podcast; to each his own cultural flags and lapel pins. But the stylistic arena of text and images is so exponentially more vast, and so much easier to negotiate a rewarding path through, it’s hard not to think of the format as broken, a dead end. Perhaps that’s why many come and go so quickly.</p>
<p><span class="outright">Tim Bray twat something <a href="http://twitter.com/timbray/statuses/790892892">the other day</a> which I think goes to a core problem with podcasts: they’re useless unless you’re driving, or cooking, or exercising, or doing anything at all other than thinking.</span></p>
<p>That said, and as eagerly as I concur with Maciej’s timeless <a href="http://www.idlewords.com/audio-manifesto.txt">slapaway</a> of the early hype, it seems podcasts have to an extent matured, however little they’ve ‘revolutionised’ ‘blogging’. And the early awkwardnesses of delivery are clearly gone as well: consider the various excellent tools that iTunes offers to let you get to your music. Sorts, searches, ratings, playlists, smart folders: all good stuff, and I can’t think of much more you could do to make navigation easier, but despite having music absolutely ground into my <span class="caps">DNA</span>, I still gravitate more nowadays to podcasts. I realise this has more to do with their listen-once-then-delete nature versus the pleasures of hearing music again, but the way iTunes and iPods handle podcasts is just so much better: you know right away how recent something is and whether it’s been heard or not. Both will happily resume playing an item at the exact spot you paused it weeks before. And of course the process of passive subscription via <span class="caps">XML</span> feed is perfectly executed.</p>
<p>As to the qualities of maturity, here’s what I currently listen to:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/audio_video/podcasts/the_bugle/">The Bugle – Audio Newspaper for a Visual World</a><br /><em>The Daily Show</em>’s John Oliver and standup Andy Zaltzmann bicker, snark, and bicker some more about the week’s news. Very funny and surprisingly rude considering it’s done under the imprimatur of the <em>Times</em> of London.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/starttheweek.shtml">Start the Week</a><br />The best cultural round-table show in existence, I think. Every week the BBC’s Andrew Marr gathers together a group of people with something to plug, and forces them to comment on each other’s work. This can get uncomfortable. First thing I listen to when it shows up late Monday.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/filmprogramme/filmprogramme.shtml">The Film Programme</a><br />The BBC’s Friday afternoon movie show. Don’t care about the star interviews or the poets brought in to review the new releases, I just like Francine Stock’s voice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Podcast.aspx">This American Life</a><br />No words needed, really.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/frontrow/">Front Row Highlights</a><br />Always good weekly wrapup of the week-nightly <span class="caps">BBC</span> arts and letters programme. Mark Lawson is a very sharp writer and broadcaster, but if there is such a thing as an English honky, his voice would be easily considered the definition thereof.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/ross/">Jonathan Ross Podcast</a><br />Those unfamiliar with Jonafan Woss’s TV talk shows and radio gig at BBC2 may recall him cavorting and picnicking with Ricky Gervais in the second series of <em>Extras.</em> Standard celebrity interviews and banter about his dogs, fascination with contemporary Japanese kitsch, usually worth a chuckle while, I don’t know, making lunch.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive/entertainment/kermode.shtml">Mark Kermode’s Film Reviews</a><br />This is the only radio that I sometimes listen to streamed live. A vainglorious, tetchy, pompadoured skiffle musician with the balls to refer to himself as ‘Dr Kermode’ because he once completed a thesis on genre fiction bickers with the rather more sports-focused host about the week’s movies. Kermode is best when he goes off on a tear, the <em>Da Vinci Code</em> and <em>Pirates of the Caribbean </em><span class="caps"><em>III</em></span> rants being good examples easily found via a quick boo at them video sharing sites.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_detail.php?siteId=7060034">Fresh Air</a><br />It kind of irks me that this flawlessly researched and always interesting show lets its political allegiances slip so often, whether I agree with them or not, but Terry Gross is easily the interviewer I most want to hear confront the creative and the powerful. And Gene Simmons. Less xsittinginforterrygross though, please.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/">Wait Wait, Don’t Tell Me</a><br />The format never changes, Carl Kassell never gets the jokes, but it’s always hilarious, in that gentle, not-too-far, <span class="caps">NPR</span> way.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/">On the Media</a><br />Even more politically slanted than <em>Fresh Air,</em> but always interesting and tenacious. Wish they’d change the theme music one of these decades.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.studio360.org">Studio 360</a><br />With Kurt Andersen, the only <em>Spy</em> magazine founder who didn’t go on to embody everything that <em>Spy</em> magazine used to mock. Great piece recently about Will Self’s habit of getting into town from airports on foot.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/podcasts/index.html">Stephen Fry’s Podgrams</a><br />For someone so relentlessly deft with language, the neologisms he’s been flinging about at stephenfry.com (‘blessays’,‘blisquisitions’,‘podgrams’) are downright cloth-eared, but no matter: the posts are great, the geekery is great, and the podcasts are just bliss, as intimate as good narrative radio, but notably, what, self-consciously unselfconscious? So much has been said about Fry’s ability to just <em>talk,</em> and here, in unedited and largely improvised sessions, he does just that.</p>
<p>(I was going to mention <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/">Radiolab</a>, but stopped subscribing to it because as much of a fan of Robert Krulwich I am, the mannered nature of the show’s production makes listening to it not unlike trying to read a good science book surrounded by kids on a playdate, and then there’s <a href="http://youlooknicetoday.com/">YLNT</a>, but that one’s on a timeout for now, until we can have a wee bit less merkins and baby vomit.)</p>

<h3><span class="outleft">22 Apr 2008, 2pm</span></h3>
		
<p>It likely goes back to the childhood tendency to resist bedtime because you don’t want to miss out on anything, but after a lifetime of thinking of sleep (or, more precisely, the effort of getting to sleep chemically unaided) as an enemy of sorts – a boring frustration to wage a war of resistance against – I’m now that guy who’ll willingly hit the sack at, say, nine, and get up at, say, five or six. Living rurally this is of course standard; people get cracking early because there’s work to be done, real work involving maybe the employment of machines and livestock, or the government of children, not sitting around all confused about why your left joins are borked or blathering on about your sleep habits.</p>
<p>The bonus of step-fatherhood, at least inasmuch as I’ve managed to wrangle my way into it, is never having to have gone through the years of constant sleep interruption brought on by infants. (I really don’t know how you people do that. I mean, I admire the skill and tenacity required, but find it difficult to envy: sleep anxiety or not, once you go under the last thing you want to do is stop.) When I arrived here the kids were just approaching tweenhood, now they’re away at school most of the time. Lovely when they’re here (well, ‘lovely’ factoring in every possible variation of the stupidly bothersome cliches of the worldwide alliance of teenaged girls rulebook) but when they’re not, meh, I’m going to need someone to explain the downside of this ‘empty nest syndrome’ to me in plain language. Plus I can sleep whenever I want.</p>
<p><span class="outright">No matter how early I get up, the landlord slash neighbour slash troublesome IT client’s lights will already be on. As a retired bureaucrat, he has no real labour to get to; most likely he’s doodling little hearts and teddy bears in his Nicolas Sarkozy notebook.</span></p>
<p>Anyway I’m pretty sure it’s not the quiet tranquility of the early morning that has caused this behaviour shift – quiet tranquility piles up like uncollected trash here in hicktown France. It’s not the <span class="caps">GTD</span>, cleared inbasket, mailbox zero efficiency that the extra time offers (though it is useful to get a head start violating the copyright of whatever interesting happened to be on television the night before throughout the commonwealth of english-speaking content provision, and, for better or worse, I suppose it’s had a lot to do with the return of this site). It’s not the beauty of sunrise, so much in favour with businessmen after that first heart attack. I’m hoping it’s enough to conclude that it’s learning, however late, to think of a day as connected in some way to what went on during the one previous, and what will on the one following, rather than treating a day, as I have for years and years, as something to pad with distractions and microscopic achievements until it’s time once more to wage war with sleep. I’m aiming to have some understanding of this time-as-continuum business when I grow up, but in the meantime Russian poetry has started making a lot more sense.</p>
<p>The dogs, amazingly, are approaching this new early-rising folderol with rather less nuance, reflecting not at all on anyone’s considerations of sleep and time. Their math is simple: light plus vertical people means dogs go out for walk then dogs eat full stop. They’re reasonably well-behaved – not Cesar Milan well-behaved, not dog borstal either – and the natural weimaraner tendency to own the room at all times has been lessened over the years, but Hugo before the morning walk, man. Imagine commanding a rolling tank to keep it down and hold on a minute before flattening that there house, fella.</p>
<p>Given that we prefer to take the boys out for their walk together, if I get up at, say, six, and Herself opts to sleep until, say, nine, the dog choices are as follows:</p>
<p><em>Leave both in the bedroom with Herself</em><br /> This results in both dogs pacing, whining, and pressing the small of her back with cold wet noses in case she is unaware that, hello, the day has begun, but I get some nice quiet time downstairs to drink coffee and write bullshit like this.</p>
<p><em>Leave Oliver in the bedroom and bring Hugo downstairs</em> <br /> On his own, Hugo can be weirdly calm, even in advance of the walk. He’ll just sit at attention beside my desk, confusedly staring. Oliver, upstairs, will be pacing and whining, but to a smaller degree than if Hugo were there (they bring out the worst in each other). He’ll also climb up on the bed when I’m not around, the presumptuous bounder.</p>
<p><em>Leave Hugo in the bedroom and bring Oliver downstairs</em><br /> This is not an option, as Hugo’s tendency to go jealously mental if there’s any possibility Oliver is having more fun than he will contribute, eventually, to the universe collapsing on itself.</p>
<p><em>Bring both dogs downstairs</em><br /> This can work. Let the boys out for a quick drain in the back yard, then they just sort of hang, quietly anxious, in my office. I can usually shush the pacing and whining, but if it gets to be too much, the all-purpose timeout zone that is the <a href="http://textism.com/oliver/tag/caged+life">cages</a> in the room next door works a treat. So long as the occasional rustle of noise indicates I’m still nearby, they’re perfectly calm. However. If I leave my office for any length of time, for, say, ablutions or another cup of coffee: imagine the sound of a packed kennel just as a cat steps through the front door, and multiply by seven.</p>

I mean, to use “pants” at all reveals a man who knows his Amis (and not just his amis), a Londoner at heart; and the addition of “complete” is Canadian through and through; but to say something looks “like” pants is pure American, surely.

<p>Surely any semantic machine doing semantic machine-reading will be semantically smart enough to know what to look for. Do <em>we</em> really need to think about it every time?</p>
<p>Just a feed that works will do nicely kthxbai.</p>
<p><span class="outleft">20 Apr 2008, 11am</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>  Having seen <a href="http://mooseyard.com/Jens/2008/04/why-theyre-doing-this/">some</a> <a href="http://db79.com/2008/04/web-broswers-html-and-multiple-xml-feed-formats/">responses</a> to this, it’s clear I should’ve been less terse here. My point is that feed autodiscovery as it is in Safari (and Firefox, Camino, Firefox 2 on XP, Opera, iCab) is a very good thing, and I agree it’s perfect for <a href="http://www.grabup.com/uploads/d53a25a01f9c221c3165447922e0cd6c.png">this sort of application</a>, allowing feeds carrying different content to be quickly tweezed out without one having to hunt for links on a page. If however you argue that multiple formats are important because, say, Microsoft prefers <span class="caps">RSS</span> while Google prefers Atom, then it’s trivial for you, Microsoft and Google to work that out amongst yourselves (think <span class="caps">CSS</span>). Just please don’t require every single person who tries a feed autodiscovery popup to have to decide if they want their ice cream served in a boot, a Pontiac, or a waffle cone.</p>

<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>  Oh, clarity, clarity.

I merely happened to be subscribing to his feed and was reminded how annoying this particular annoyance is.
