<p>Okay, so: a couple weeks in, thirteen items – whup, I guess fourteen now. Long mea culpa: check; lazy satire of silly hype: check; dork meme: check; create even more unhelpful about page than that dinosaur from 2003: check; unnecessarily detailed food porn: check; bit of oldskoollinkylove: check. What else what else. Oh: write for the sake of writing.</p>
<p>Where we live now is forty five minutes from everywhere. It takes just as long to get to Nîmes as to Avignon, to Alès as to Orange. Montpellier and Marseille (much more desirable destinations) are an hour and fifteen minutes each. Montpellier is the good Asian food store, the good Apple-centric shop and, lately, Ikea. Marseille is the international airport and, until recently, Ikea.</p>
<p>It’s only now, in my forties, that I’ve developed involuntary physical reactions to trivial stimuli. For example there’s that Scandinavian pop song (whistling, bongo drums) from last year that was firmly, intractably stuck in my head during a patch of time that was so bad it seemed the world was quietly and meticulously toiling away at ever more bad news to send my way. Song and bad patch are melded together, like chewing gum and sand. I’ve deleted the song from every device and playlist, but each time I go to the more desirable grocery store (seven minutes away, as opposed to the less desirable’s five), I keep forgetting that they play its opening hook over the PA every fifteen minutes or so, presumably to perk my attention before a honeyed voice-over artist delivers the assertion that the experience of shopping there (not the goods therein, nor the store itself) is making my life simpler. In some ways this is true, but let me not digress.</p>
<p>So the scene goes like this: tallish, po-faced man is scanning the dairy aisle for the ever-elusive, elastic and frankly invisible dividing lines between <em>yaourt,</em> <em>fromage frais</em> and <em>fromage blanc;</em> he has a crinkled look that says, <em>this really should make more sense,</em> and then whup, here comes the big whistle and the bongo drums, and he twitches around in a three-quarter turn as though someone had just emptied a cup of warm water into his waistband. There is little dignity in this.</p>
<p>I think it’s pure coincidence that the other example of a small stimulus – I refer here to Ikea – causing involuntary reaction is Scandinavian, but perhaps not. I do know that what greets you when you walk in the door: the smell of dirty children screaming in the ball room, the smell of cheap sausage meat steaming, right beside the entrance, in the exit snäkbär, the smell of <span class="caps">MDF</span>, of balsawood, of Lithuanian pine, the knowing you’ll have to do the grand tour or get lost rather than just find something and leave, the cheap shittiness of everything on display, even the little fucking pencils, combined with that fact this inescapable blue-and-yellow <em>thing</em> has gotten rich via one of the most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stichting_INGKA_Foundation" title="charitable">elaborate tax dodges in human history</a>, well. Last time I actually started twitching in the parking lot.</p>
<p>And that darling one is why we’re not going to Ikea any more.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.granta.com/Online-Only/Thirty-Years-of-Granta-Covers">Thirty years of Granta covers</a>. Stupid flash interface (+ beside ⇥ beside ▸ means what now?) but a grand nostalgia ride all the same.<br /></li>
<li>‘Stephen Fry and the Machine That Made Us’. On <span class="caps">BBC4</span> last Monday night (UK residents can see it on the <span class="caps"> BBC</span>’s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/b009wynj.shtml">iPlayer</a>, for the rest of us it’s up on the usual, erm, channels). Surprisingly thorough documentary in which the Man with a Brain the Size of Hugh Laurie is humbled and amazed by all that went into the production of Gutenberg’s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_bible">Bible</a></em>. He cuts, smoke-proofs and casts type (well, an e), has interesting asides on what really goes into making vellum and on Gutenberg’s financial woes, makes paper from rag pulp, assists in the building of a press, prints a page, and, finally, dons the cotton gloves to leaf through a copy of the real deal. Fry’s shows are always a treat – his journey on the genealogy program ‘Who Do You Think You Are’ a couple years ago was truly moving – and this’n be no exception.</li>
<li><a href="http://carolcookskeller.blogspot.com/">French Laundry at Home</a>. Similar in scope to the <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0001399/">Julie/Julia Project</a> of a few years ago. How nice is it to have someone going through a daunting cookbook recipe by recipe so you don’t have to. My own experience with <em>The French Laundry Cookbook</em> has so far been limited to failing at making the veal stock, but this site does give one courage.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sadcom.com/labels/index.htm">Soviet soft drink labels</a>. Happened upon while looking around for info on the 1970s Pepsi/Stolichnaya barter deal. ‘Printing plants were centralized. There were two plants in Leningrad which were printing labels for ¼ of the whole country.’ Evidently only one standard die shape too.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.designobserver.com/archives/035324.html">Thirty Tables of Contents</a>. Strangely dry collection of <span class="caps">TOC</span>s published in pamphlet form by the <span class="caps">AIGA</span> last year. Other than <em>Air Guitar,</em> the Nabokov and of course the Bringhurst<em>,</em> I fear there’s not much there, there.</li>

<p>(Shameless plug ahead, but it’s a good one.)</p>
<p>Our friends Ruth and Julian live over on the other side of the Rhône, in hardcore garlic-and-tomatoes Provence, right at the foot of the inescapable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Ventoux" title="Wikipedia entry on a big hill">Mont Ventoux</a>. Despite preferring cats over dogs they’re good people; less, you know, <em>English</em> than a lot of the expats who live down here. She’s an accomplished <a href="http://ruthphillips.com/">cellist </a>(as far as I’m aware the only person I know to have played on a Portishead album) and he’s a painter. We’ve been playing dinner party tennis for a few years now, which is always good loud fun.</p>
<p><span class="outright">Nice <em>NY Times</em> piece on Julian’s work <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2006/02/22/garden/20060223_CURR_SLIDESHOW_1.html">here</a>.</span></p>
<p>Anyway for the past couple years Julian, while doing larger commissioned work, has also been painting little gems – ‘Postcards from Provence’ – every day and putting them for sale <a href="http://shiftinglight.com">on his site</a>. At first they went for $100 a pop, and would always be snapped up a few seconds after appearing. Then, in the past year or so, the paintings have been up for auction on a mini-ebayish application that may or may not have been built by me.</p>
<p>You really do want to have one of these small treasures in your home. <a href="http://auction.shiftinglight.com">I direct you there at once</a>. Bid strong and bid often. Transactions are via PayPal, and he ships worldwide for Iike peanuts. Go! <em>Go!</em></p>
