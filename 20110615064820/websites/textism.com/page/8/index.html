<p>This is good, my friend. It will transform you. </p>
<p>Getcherself a kilogram or so of lamb or mutton shoulder and/or shank, and have the butcher saw both meat and bone into manageable chunks.</p>
<p>Prepare three litres of an 8% brine solution. 8% = 80g salt per litre of water, so dissolve 240g salt in as little boiling water as will absorb it, then add enough ice water (the solution should be as close to freezing as possible) to make three litres. Brine the meat in a big ol’ zip-loc bag in the fridge for a good six hours – I wouldn’t go overnight, it’ll get too salty – then drain, rinse, and let the pieces air-dry in the fridge, ideally overnight.</p>
<p>Brown the meat quickly but thoroughly in olive oil until nicely coloured. The ideal vessel here is the heavy cast-iron dutch oven in which the dish will complete its cooking, though any ovenproof, large metal pot will get the job done. When browning, work in small batches, as you need adequate space between pieces for steam to escape, elsewise the sugars in the meat will melt and boil rather than caramelise.</p>
<p>While the meat browns, use a mortar and pestle or food processor to mash together a rough paste of chopped fresh green or red chiles (as many, and as hot, as you can stand), shredded fresh ginger, smashed garlic cloves, minced shallots, chopped fresh coriander (leaves and stems), black peppercorns and olive oil. You should end up with half a cup of paste.</p>
<p>Put the browned meat aside and pour off any burnt oil left in the pot before frying the paste in fresh oil for a minute or so, stirring and scraping constantly. Return the meat to the pot and arrange in a fairly tight layer. Cover with water or stock and bring to a boil while dicing up a cup or so each of sweet potato, carrot and onion. (During this first stovetop braise these vegetables will fall apart, thickening and enriching the braising liquid, so don’t worry about being tidy.)</p>
<p><span class="outright">It’s crucial this first braise be done with the meat on the bone: basically you’re making a good lamb stock <em>in situ.</em></span></p>
<p>Add the chopped vegetables along with a couple teaspoons of the spice mixture <a href="http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/recipes/display/recipe_id/799/">ras al-hanut</a>, a generous squeeze of honey and a splodge of tomato paste. Let the pot bubble just at the boil. After 90 minutes or so start checking to see if the meat is becoming fall-off-the-bone tender. Once it is, remove it, set aside to cool, then separate and discard the bones. Set the oven to 150°.</p>
<p>Presentation vegetables can now be added, with the deboned meat, to the broth: any combination you like of small firm potatoes, sliced sweet potatoes, chunks of carrot, quartered tomatoes, small peeled or large quartered onions, maybe chickpeas. These will be given a slow even braise in the oven, and should retain their shape and colour to the end.</p>
<p>Add a handful of dried apricots, check for salt, and bring back to a boil before placing the covered pot in the oven for at least an hour, until the vegetables are tender but still firm.</p>
<p>Spoon onto couscous, with chopped fresh coriander. Om nom nom nom.</p>

<h3><span class="outleft">12 Apr 2008, 2pm</span></h3>
		
<p>Great, great setup. Two unsteady, fortyish siblings – he a theatre professor with no soul, she a writer without any ideas (she taps out grant applications for unproduceable plays while pretending to work as a temp). All they share as adults are the memories of an unpleasant childhood – mom legged it early on, dad was indifferent and something of a dick – and the sudden news that the father, sliding into dementia on the other side of the country, can no longer take care of himself.</p>
<p>And how can you not look forward to a movie with both Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney in it? I don’t recall ever watching either of them and <em>not</em> thinking that something wonderful was going on there, although as caregiver to Jason Robards in <em>Magnolia</em> he really had nothing to work with, and nobody should ever have to be the comic sidekick to Ben Stiller. As for Linney, well, I think it’s best to make like <em>Love, Actually</em> never happened.</p>
<p><span class="outright"><img src="/img/savages_1.png" alt="Laura Linney in The Savages" width="115" height="62" /></span></p>
<p>Here she’s just a jewel: she defines Wendy Savage – manipulative but sweet, morally focused but misled by skewed self-image and blurry ambition, uncomfortable in her single-woman-with-cat apartment – with such clarity and skill you draw a quick breath. In the middle of being half-heartedly, joylessly banged by her lothario building superintendent, she reaches out to caress his dog.</p>
<p>Hoffman, as Jon Savage, is of course just so fucking <em>good.</em> No use trying to convey the man’s ease with subtle gestures and ability to inhabit a character: you’re as aware of it as I am.</p>
<p><span class="outright"><img src="/img/savages_2.png" alt="The Savages" width="115" height="62" /></span></p>
<p>The dry bassline of uneasy comedy that runs through the picture is just right, similar in many ways to Noah Baumbach’s last couple of films. Brother and sister bicker and shoot each other down, and it’s good fun, but, amid the relentless reminders of how hard it must be to deal with the decline of a parent, the on-again, off-again warmth between the two is convincing and unforced, showing a wonderfully sure hand on the part of writer/director Tamara Jenkins, where other filmmakers would have given in to the need for quickly-resolved narrative arcs and easy generosity between characters over the monotonies and messy disappointments of real life. And thanks to her as well for respecting the audience enough to strongly infuse parts of the movie with that nursing home smell: it’s real, it’s going to happen, we all need to get used to it.</p>
<p><span class="outright"><img src="/img/savages_3.png" alt="The Savages" width="115" height="62" /></span></p>
<p>The great Philip Bosco plays the father with angry helplessness; really strong stuff. And there’s a quietly perfect little appearance by Gbenga Akinnagbe, who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Partlow" title="Chris Partlow - Wikipedia">killed a lot of people</a> on <em>The Wire</em>.</p>
<p>Having seen both now, it’s disappointing this perfectly restrained, funny, sad, resonant script lost the Oscar to the enjoyable but too-too glib <em>Juno,</em> but whatever. Go you Huskies.</p>

<p>Dude I thought we’d gone over all this. Some time ago I was flipping through the <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RhzXHJHEL._SS400_.jpg" title="Steamed Motorola?">latest</a> from <em>oogy woogy daddy wuv to see me lick custard from a spoon boobs boobs chocolate boobs aren’t children lovely mrs charles saatchi,</em> and, there alongside the relentless food photography, golly, the designer sure had done his or her level best to make me mad as heck.</p>
<p>I mean, the age of OpenType started some years ago, and there’s no reason at all continue to design as though the buttons on your keyboard represent the full extent of what’s typographically available. Take setting the ingredients for a recipe: no excuse whatsoever to do something stupid with super/subscript like ¹/₂ cup (or, worse: 1/2 cup) when ½ cup is just as easy if not easier, scans beautifully, communicates precisely and unobtrusively, and is provided to you as a courtesy by the type vendor.</p>
<p>The following assumes you’re on Leopard, you’re using InDesign, <span class="outright">If you’re still using Quark, stop being a dink. Go sit in the corner.</span>you’ve <em>paid for</em> and installed OpenType fonts. This will provide easy access to the full range of glyphs in the font you’re working in. InDesign has a glyphs palette built in, but it’s quite primitive: you want to use the one that comes bundled with Leopard.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, get the input menu into your toolbar: System Preferences → International → Input Menu → ✓ Show input menu in menu bar → ✓ Character Palette. Then, wherever you’re working, pull it up:</p>
<p><img src="/img/input_menu.png" alt="Mac OSX input menu" width="212" height="186" /></p>
<p>And marvel at one of the most gorgeous interfaces ever conceived:</p>
<p><img src="/img/character_palette.png" alt="Mac OSX character input palette" width="434" height="697" /></p>
<p>Seriously, it’s <em>beautiful.</em> Now note the Search input down at the bottom of the palette. Type in what you’re looking for:</p>
<p><img src="/img/character_palette_search.png" alt="Mac OS character palette search" width="310" height="326" /></p>
<p>And up pops a list of everything related to what you’ve entered. You can tell the palette to insert the glyph directly into the doc you’re working on, or copy it to the clipboard, or make a bumper sticker for all I care.</p>
<p>Here’s a good tip: set the prefs for the palette to ‘Minimize Palette on Application Switch’: when not in use, it just sits quietly in the corner of your screen showing only the last glyph you selected.</p>

<p>When it first appeared in late 2006, Twitter seemed to me like a genuinely stupid idea. Great, more web whatever point whosit social networking blarf for those with a permanently internet-eroded attention span. But, then again, since 1966 I’ve received maybe thirteen <span class="caps">SMS</span>s, and sent about the same number – don’t even know how to do so on the current shoephone – so clearly I’m not in the target demo. And there was just something so, ugh, web whatever point whosit class-conscious about it. I mean, I like Maggie Mason and the stuff she does a lot, and even she might agree that that ‘just landed in LA’ on the twitter.com front page has got to be up there among the most unctuously precious things ever. Hey you, mister startup: please don’t try to sell me your fancy new gizmo with the same sort of air-quoted, I-didn’t-say-it-<em>you</em>-did fabulousity with which the dolts at <em>Vanity Fair</em> service the celebrity trade.</p>
<p>You’ll agree that everything deserves a second chance. A few months ago Twitter started slowly making sense. I’m not sure I concur that, as some have said, the constraints of 140 characters will force anyone to think or write in a meaningfully new way, but there’s something attractive about this throwaway stream of rants, thoughts, links, asides. Fragments of the lives of others just drift in, make you smile, or wince, or roll your eyes for a second, and then disappear. Very little offered, nothing expected in return. I can get behind that.</p>
<p>Sitting here midday at my desk when it’s evening tomorrow on the other side of the world, it’s admittedly fun to watch drunken Australians twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/kibitzer/statuses/785710486" title="Twitter / River Kleenex">back</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewbarnett/statuses/785711497" title="Twitter / andrew barnett">forth</a> about how, you know, drunk they are. I keep wondering if <a href="http://ftrain.com" title="Ftrain.com">Ford</a>’s attempts to <a href="http://twitter.com/ftrain" title="I think they're not real, Bob">constrict the format</a> even further constitute a brilliant new advance in letters or if he’s just like one of those borderline <span class="caps">OCD</span> sufferers who can only speak in six-syllable phrases. It turns out that Tim Bray is actually a pretty <a href="http://twitter.com/timbray/statuses/782921463">funny</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/timbray/statuses/785083047">guy</a>. I use it for <a href="http://twitter.com/textism/statuses/785871314">anger management</a>. And I must of course now direct you at once to <a href="http://twitter.com/fireland" title="Josh Allen (no relation)">the only Twitter stream that really matters</a>.</p>
<p>Why did I bring this up again? Right, the whole point was just to inform those who enjoy <a href="http://textism.com/oliver/daily">Oliver, Daily</a> they can now be notified of a new photo <a href="http://twitter.com/OliverDaily">via Twitter</a>, and then it got all cranky and linkylinky and <em>Vanity Fair</em> and stuff. I’ll try to keep that in check.</p>

<p>This peony struck me as being rather blowsy and show-offish, and possessed of quite an excess of strut given its young age, so I shall knock it down a few pegs and put its picture on the internet without even asking.</p>
