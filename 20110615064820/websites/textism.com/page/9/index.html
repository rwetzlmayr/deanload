<p>In the mid-to-late nineties I worked for a long, weird, sometimes happy stretch as a professional book designer. People would ask, <em>So what do you do for a living,</em> and I’d reply,<em> I’m a book designer, actually,</em> and they’d nod and squint a little and say something like, <em>So … that’s the covers?</em> and I’d say, <em>Well, yes, sometimes I’m hired to come up with the cover for a paperback or the jacket for a hardcover: this involves doing a lot of research and an assload of work to turn out multiple proposals on spec months, or even years, in advance of anything actually being considered ‘in production’ (and by that I mean ‘billable’), and even after the countless meetings at which you stand there like a knob holding up your well-crafted ideas in front of a committee and reply in calm, sane sentences to the concerns of Betsy from marketing about whether green is going to resonate with the right people, and to the publisher’s conviction that titles that aren’t centred on the layout will convey a lack of stateliness, and to Marty from sales’ belief that black and white photography just isn’t going to cut it with the chains, and though the editor has been toiling away without so much as a peep of input you’re pacing back and forth like Jack McCoy explaining to the jury why it’s important and crucial they understand what it means to do the right thing, and then there’s this great bit where the production schedule gets more harried as the press deadline approaches, and your tiny slice of time to finish the job with all its last minute changes eventually compressing down to the space between Letterman and breakfast on the one night when all you really required of life was a little sleep, and anyway it’s just a fucking advert, just the foil wrapper on the Wonder Bread, stop imagining that people are so stupid they only buy books to fit their lifestyle, rather than to have something interesting to read, I mean just look at all the cumulative labour that went into all that grey crap on the paper inside! Shit! Oh, anyway, yeah I do covers but I prefer to do the guts, thanks for asking.</em> Sometimes they’d still be listening.</p>
<p>Anyway, the joke among my colleagues (in one form or another, the joke used by every graphic designer ever to doodle a thumbnail) was, wouldn’t it be fun to have an app that, with minimal input, would crank out a finished layout automatically for you: sort of a Microsoft FrontPage for cover design, complete with clip art and stock photos and wacky shareware type and ISBNs and barcodes. Well, fuck me, after all this time <a href="http://bookcoverpro.com" title="I want my mid-to-late nineties back!">it’s been done</a>. Spend a few moments taking in those samples. Awesome.</p>
<p>If ever I attend another cover review meeting, I think I’ll just stand there with the confidence and stoicism of a man aware of the power of his tools, answering all comments with, <em>It’s <span class="caps">BCP</span>, man, you just don’t understand. It knows.</em></p>

<p><span class="outright"><img src="http://textism.com/img/safarikern.png" alt="Safari kerning" width="85" height="70" /><br />Safari: right face, bad kern</span></p>
<p>Here’s a seemingly insurmountable, earth-in-the-balance problem I could use some help with. Safari evidently has no trouble rendering a standard, Apple-installed font face like Helvetica Neue Light when it’s named in <span class="caps">CSS</span> by its PostScript handle ‘HelveticaNeue-Light’, but it ignores the font’s metrics and kerns letter pairs like David Carson on a bad day. I’d thought <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Text" title="Wikipedia article on Apple's Core Text technology">Core Text</a> was a system-wide thing these days, but then I’ve been out of it for awhile.</p>
<p><span class="outright"><img src="http://textism.com/img/firefoxkern.png" alt="Firefox kerning" width="85" height="70" /><br />Firefox: wrong face, decent kern</span></p>
<p>Firefox and other mozilla browsers, on the other hand, <em>won’t</em> render a standard, Apple-installed font like Helvetica Neue Light, cascading past it to the plain Roman, however the kerning seems to be respected.</p>
<p>I’ve tried using <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssatten/" title="A List Apart article on @font-face">@font-face</a> rules to refer to a TrueType file of the font, but then it just gets weirder: Safari loads it, but the metrics are even more wonky. Firefox (as of the 3.0b5 I’m using) won’t load the .ttf file at all.</p>
<p>As Fielding Goodney¹ <span class="outright">¹Martin Amis, <cite>Money</cite></span>would have it, ‘I hate it when I can’t <em>figure</em> things’. Any browser geeks out there who can shed some light on this, or suggest workarounds? (Other than doing pictures of words that is, not keen on that.) Dean at this domain. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>  <a href="http://blog.kno.at/">Christian Knoflach</a> points out that Firefox 2, unlike Firefox 3 beta, <em>will</em> render any system font as long as you reference its screen name, e.g., “Helvetica Neue Light”, but FF2 still has Safari’s bad letterspacing problem. Here’s hoping the release version of Firefox 3 will solve both issues, and all will be good and right for the seventeen of us in the world who care about this sort of malarkey.</p>
<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span> 2  Evidently kerning in Safari has been an <a href="http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6136">issue of complaint</a> for some time (thx Daniele). </p>
<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">LAST </span> <a href="http://l-c-n.com/">Philippe Wittenbergh</a> (and a few others I stupidly brushed off earlier for suggesting font-weight was the way to do it) says that FF3 beta <em>does</em> know what it’s doing when it comes to rendering different weights (and not simply shaving off pixels as older browsers have done):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What Gecko 1.9 (Firefox 3) does is correct by the logic of <span class="caps">CSS</span>.</p>
<p>You select a font ‘family’ (Helvetica Neue), and then a specific face (by font-weight in this case).</p>
<p>p {font-family: ‘Helvetica Neue’,  sans-serif; font-weight: 300;}</p>
<p>This will work correctly in Gecko and, when it comes out, Safari 3.2 (full support for various font-weights was only checked in in Webkit last Friday, 2008.04.04).</p>
<p>Add ‘HelveticaNeue-Light’ for backwards compatibility with older browsers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Safari in the near future, and looky here. Firefox 3.0b5, you beautiful bastard you:</p>

<p>Still looks like complete pants on Windows, but no surprises there. Thanks to all for the tips.</p>

<p>Yeah so we do a user-centric citizen-media social network for women and gay men who’ve just totally dumped (or been dumped by) their partner, no-good slackass douche that he is/was/will no doubt continue to be, right? Tumblelogs, podcasts, rich-client video conversations. Integration with all popular platforms, including Twitter, of course, except that’s through a proprietary app called Bitter. Every newly liberated user who has something to say about some <span class="caps">ASSHOLE</span> can trash talk away through various favourited, taggable channels about how they should have listened to their friends slash parents slash myspace about how he so was not right and anyway girl you’ll be stronger for it. Hold up his skidmarked underpants to the webcam for all to see. Recite his car-crash poetry. Demonstrate in one click just how lame his band is. Rails backend will be coded in twenty minutes and will never go down ever. Revenue model <span class="caps">TBD</span>.</p>
<p>What to call it? Something sharp and clean, like Mister Ex, no wait, <span class="caps">MRX</span>. Yeah, that’s got the burr of singularity, the hook. I can get the domain, it’s only <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?from=R40&amp;_trksid=m37&amp;satitle=mrx.com" title="Free shipping though">twenty million dollars</a>. Per year. Funding offers to the usual address.</p>

<p>Back to square one, then. It’s been about four years since I’ve thought about writing on this site. No time like the present, as they say, to see what I can do about fouling the air once again.</p>
<p>If anyone’s been wondering where I’ve been for the past few years of sparse updates, vague rumours and patent abandonments, read on.</p>
<p>Four years ago I was leading a popular open source software project, born out of a hobbyist desire to tinker with scripts and make things easier to publish on my own ferociously twee web site. I started a company, born out of a practical desire to stop being rice-and-beans poor, which grew like kudzu. It had this insane business model that featured actual people buying an actual product with, you know, actual money. Things boomed along. I did a lot of Ambienned air travel between Paris and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Business being business, there were of course problems and conflicts, growing pains and resentments. I could handle the bad decisions, the things breaking, the angry customers, the occasional shitty, fireable customer. And much of it was great: the gracious and welcoming community, the pleasure of working with the very, very talented. What became gradually clear, however, was the nagging sensation that along the way I was turning into a person I swore I’d never be: a person quite capable of saying and doing things I now regret in a really rather stinging way. We’re not talking war crimes here, and I don’t want to get all melodramatic about it, but things. Money, when it travels at a certain trajectory and speed, can make anyone into an asshole.</p>
<p>And, for me as for others, at some point the frenetic pleasures of bootstrapping and entrepreneurial ground-floorism – of littering the road to success with spectacular failures – can find themselves entirely dwarved by the realisation you genuinely <em>don’t</em> know what you’re doing, and perhaps it’s time to get out of the way. This moment of clarity, reached some time in late 2006, led me to withdraw from day to day duty in the company I founded, theoretically to regroup and find, oh what’s the term, focus. And then I went insane.</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to imagine what the best way to describe last year would be. Half the time – the half I’m certain was completely out of my control – I handled every stimulus like it was about to explode, and felt very much like an old coat on a broken hanger rumbling along in an old, broken truck. Unpleasant but the sort of thing that, at the time, you just sort of blink your way through and be glad there’s somewhere to sleep at night. The other half of the time, well, that was the hard labour: stamping down into paste anything at all that remained of my youth, energy, curiosity, skill, relationships; consuming cubic kilometres of cheap red wine, crushing out one cigarette after another, filling – what, a couple <em>thousand?</em> – hours with the stupidest possible television, the sort of shiny gunk that makes you both fantasise about harming the people who make it and revel in its easy access to pleasure circuits, of being down in its muck. Hard, hard, labour. Seriously: I don’t remember last summer.</p>
<p>From today’s perspective, I’m lucky to be alive. No, even in the blackest haze I didn’t come close to <em>that</em> particular atrocity (though the fucker was certainly in the room a few times). It’s because I quite literally stopped remembering to look both ways before crossing a street.</p>
<p>I have to mention there were and are constants, touchstones. My darling beloved Gail, who has dealt with a lot in her life, has over the course of the past year singlehandedly defined what it means to deal with <span class="caps">WAY</span> <span class="caps">WAY</span> <span class="caps">MORE</span> than a lot and soldier on with grace and wit regardless. I owe her the sun, moon and several stars.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Gail has written a tiny perfect slice of memoir, coming out in a book soon, of which more later.</p>
<p><span class="outright"><a href="http://textism.com/oliver/daily/2008/04/04"><img src="http://textism.com/oliver/img/thumbs/20080404_130536.jpg" alt="Oliver, Daily" width="75" height="100" align="left" /></a></span></p>
<p>And then there are the dogs, the relentless dogs. Oliver’s going to be seven this summer, and though he still bounds around like a juiced thoroughbred on the walk every morning, he’s definitely easing into middle age. Hugo will spend the summer coming up with new ways to destroy everything in his path. I like the dogs, but you knew that.</p>
<p>Since the new year I’m quite confident the grim realities of the recent past are as over as I need them to be. For now, I’m back doing the stuff I love: coding some web projects, and designing text again after far too long. The other day, for the first time in just over ten years, I typeset some fucking <span class="caps">POETRY</span>, for like <span class="caps">PEANUTS</span>, for a fusty old <span class="caps">LONDONBOOKPUBLISHER</span>, and it was just the greatest possible thing.</p>
<p>Alright. Thanks for letting me get all that out. See you soon.</p>
