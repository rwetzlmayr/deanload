[5]</a></p><p><p>Most people suppose that the hardest sounds for an Anglo-Saxon to pronounce in French are the &#8220;u&#8221; and the &#8220;r.&#8221; How wrong most people are.</p><p>These new sounds will soon be mastered, and you may even become quite smug with passing yourself off as a native&#8230; but don&#8217;t. Unexpected challenges lie in wait.</p><p>The only times I&#8217;ve failed to understand what for the love of Pierre a French person was saying have been when English words were involved.</p><p>I once spent many minutes talking with someone about Dire Straits and another group called Deer Straats, certain that we were speaking of two different bands, and so struck by the similarities. I&#8217;m still looking for a recording by another band called Tallkeen Eds.</p><p>I have regular bouts of panic when having to ask for an American product. Upon entering KFC <em>(ka eff say),</em> say, does one order a <em>byoockette</em> or a <em>bouquet,</em> and is it <em>salade de chou</em> or <em>ze slow</em> on the side? Who knows.</p><p>On TV, were it not for the accompanying images, we would not know who on earth are (please factor in French accent) Sayan Conaree, Gweenet Poltrov, Ali Beret, Veel Smeess, Oo Grunt, Ayzar Gramme, Roosselle Crov or Eessan Owk, to name but a few.</p><p>Bush comes out Bouche, so leads happily to such quips as &#8220;Halte &#224; la Busherie!&#8221; (Boucherie=butchery, in case you&#8217;re wondering.)</p><p>The letter I is pronounced E in French, so when talking to your local Mac dealer, do you have a problem with your e- or your i-Mac? (Note: whichever one you choose, they will choose to correct you &#8211; much in the same way that if at 6 pm you say <em>bon soir,</em> they will reply <em>bonjour,</em> and vice versa.)</p><p>My last name is Amstrog here and my first name regularly adorned with a dieresis so looks like this: Ga&#239;l or Ga&#235;l (which is very swank, but a guy&#8217;s name so mail is habitually addressed to Mister).</p><p>Ginger ale is called Canada Dry (pronounced Dree) and tonic water is Schweppes, iced tea is iced tea, weekend week-end and no-one ever says caf&#233; au lait.</p><p><em>Tide</em> is pronounced teed and <em>Levis</em> layveess, <em>Ivanhoe</em> is Eevanoay, <em>Dunhill</em> Dyooneel, <em>Marlborough</em> sounds like a Gainsbourg revival, <em>cheeseburger</em> like a pornographic threat and I sink zerfor hi ham&#8230;</p></p><hr /><p><a href="http://openbrackets.com/article/561/">Girly man [21]</a></p><p><p>It began round about page 5 of Siri Hustvedt&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0805071709/qid=1073391664/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-1694271-3500631?v=glance&#38;s=books">What I loved.</a> I stopped, said <em>Huh?</em> and re-read the paragraph that began &#8220;I bent over her and kissed the freckles on her shoulders&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>Up until then, I&#8217;d been certain that the narrator was a woman. The book itself went on to be rather good, and in parts truly fine, but this drove me to distraction throughout &#8211; and made for unintended ambiguities.</p><p>I felt the same discomfort throughout Iris Murdoch&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/014118616X/qid=1073395245/sr=1-9/ref=sr_1_9/103-1694271-3500631?v=glance&#38;s=books">The Sea, the Sea,</a> having to remind myself every three pages that the narrator was a man, which kept me from full pleasure (although I can&#8217;t say that any Murdoch has ever brought me full pleasure, she&#8217;s so darn cerebral, and sometimes annoying with clinical restraint).</p><p>I&#8217;m aware of the algorithms devised that claim to have found the keys to identifying an author&#8217;s sex based on their use of pronouns and conjunctions and an unspoken rapport with the reader, and suppose that there is some real pertinence.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312422156/qid=1073391631/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-1694271-3500631">Middlesex,</a> Jeffrey Eugenides&#8217;s hermaphrodite narrator wonders whether his/her writing is more masculine (linear) or female (circular), and offers up a lovely ambiguous blend &#8211; while another character concludes: &#8220;sex is biological; gender is cultural.&#8221;</p><p>Perhaps it does come down to different hardwiring in male and female brains &#8211; I expect that there are <em>nature vs. nurture</em> studies out there that endeavour to shed more light &#8211; but still I suspect that even if a writer were to apply the science, they would still struggle to disguise their sex. (Although I confess that I&#8217;ve been wrong a few times when reading online journals, certain that he was a she &#8211; but curiously enough, never the other way round.)</p><p>So I&#8217;ve been trying to think of a book by a female author who successfully inhabits a male voice as first person narrator, and vice-versa, and haven&#8217;t come up with much&#8230; but recall some spectacular failures, with honourable mention going to Martin Amis&#8217;s Nicola Six in <em>London Fields.</em> Dear lord.</p><p>(I&#8217;m reminded too of the inevitable panic when translating a male voice, always hopeful that I will not betray with my gender.)</p><p>I suppose that ultimately I&#8217;d like to think that, in spite of all scientific probing, there remains an element of mystery in our voices &#8211; something that no algorithm can measure.</p></p><hr /><p><a href="http://openbrackets.com/article/560/">A mantra for all seasons</a></p><p><blockquote>You shall love your crooked neighbourWith your crooked heart.&#8211; W.

Stiglitz&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393324397/qid=1071768429/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-9270365-5445741">Globalization and its Discontents</a> or Simon Sebag Montefiore&#8217;s very fine and outrageously detailed, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400042305/qid=1071768538/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-9270365-5445741?v=glance&#38;s=books">Stalin: In the Court of the Red Tsar.</a></p><blockquote>[Stalin&#8217;s] dry wit was acute but hardly Wildean. Once when Kozlovsky, the court tenor was performing at the Kremlin, the Politburo started demanding some particular song.&#8216;Why put pressure on Comrade Kozlovsky?&#8217; intervened Stalin calmly. &#8216;Let him sing what he wants.&#8217; He paused. &#8216;And I think he wants to sing Lensky&#8217;s aria from <em>Onegin.&#8217;</em> Everyone laughed and Kozlovsky obediently sang the aria.</blockquote><p>In the heat of the summer hammock, I overindulged in trashy biographies &#8211; auto and not &#8211; of which the trashiest (i.e. the one that best gave the reader the impression of having been sullied) was former valet George Jacob&#8217;s bio of his boss, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0283073705/qid=1071768885/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_0_1/026-1253496-5683623">Mr. S: The Last Word on Frank Sinatra.</a></p><blockquote>[Sinatra] couldn&#8217;t sit still and he couldn&#8217;t be alone. Thus he always needed a girl, and she didn&#8217;t have to be famous. First he&#8217;d go for his leading lady. If she wasn&#8217;t free, he&#8217;d try some famous ex, like Lana Turner, whom he&#8217;d dated in the forties, for old times. Then he&#8217;d work his way down the food chain, starting with the starlets, then the hookers, and, if all else failed, he&#8217;d call Peggy Lee who lived down the block. The name of the game was Dialling for Pussy&#8230;</blockquote><p>Then there was the brief and passionate fling with Walter Mosley, that began with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743451805/qid=1071768791/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-9270365-5445741?v=glance&#38;s=books">Little Yellow Dog</a> and followed by gobbling up the remainder of the Easy Rawlins mysteries. They&#8217;re sexy, jazz smoky, carefully wrought, and guaranteed to keep you up past your bedtime. (And you&#8217;ll never guess who dunnit, cause Easy keeps it mainly to hisself.)</p><p>But the best read all year was undoubtedly Jim Lewis&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375414177/qid=1071768925/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-9270365-5445741?v=glance&#38;s=books">The King is Dead.</a> My oh my.</p><p>Suave and taut prose, half muscle half song, the characters all drawn with unfailing empathy and sensuality, their interaction rife with undercurrents and draped in that portion of insurmountable solitude.</p><p>A man wanders in and his presence in the world etched into two pages, a man who will never appear again in the story; he&#8217;s there for those few minutes only to give his impression of the  protagonist&#8217;s walk down the street at his nadir:</p><blockquote>But as the man drew closer he realized it had something to do with his expression: closer still, and he saw that the man was weeping uncontrollably and so possessed by it that he didn&#8217;t even bother to hide his face: he just carried his grief outright on his face.</blockquote><p>Other people come and go just as soon, a reminder of how many lives we brush up against without heed. He brings on situations that make you say, <em>oh, no, don&#8217;t go there,</em> and then sails through them with astonishing grace and sanity, and tosses off lines that you&#8217;ll read three times over for their sheer loveliness.

The mere mention of the word &#8220;mall&#8221; is enough to fill me with a sense of doom and exhaustion.</p><p>I loathe having to weave my bagged-down way through schlepping throngs, temples throbbing to buzzing lights, crisp salespeople smiles, the din of consumer talk and loudspeakers pumping out jingle bells and rocked up versions of <em>Oh Holy Night,</em> wondering how on earth it has come to this, feeling anger rise and muddling over whether it&#8217;s anger at our apparently increasing infantile neediness and greediness, or anger with myself for giving into it, for simply being there.</p><p>By the end of the day, I&#8217;m on the verge of tears as I hand over my credit card one last time, acquiescing to a ludicrous price&#8230; my initial joy in finding a gift for someone I love gone hollow and dumb. Then three bucks for two feet of cheap plastic ribbon scooped around a giant spool. Feeling robbed and lessened and&#8230; Sigh.</p><p>Nagging along with the growing lassitude and peeved are questions that I ask myself each year round this time. Among the top five is why we perpetuate the Santa Claus myth with our kids &#8211; knowing full well that we&#8217;re going to have to admit at some point that we lied.</p><p>Are we saying that there isn&#8217;t enough magic already in the universe, so we have to make it up? Is it an innocent white lie that puts kids on their best behaviour for two weeks of the year, and berserk with anticipation?</p><p>We&#8217;re well past the stage in our house, but I remember my son&#8217;s disappointment and reluctance to give up the dazzling myth (mainly because his 8-year old mind figured that if you no longer believed, you no longer got presents, so relieved when his sister said, &#8216;You moron, even if you don&#8217;t believe in God, you still get presents.&#8217;)</p><p>I&#8217;m home now and again glad to be out of the city. Dinner&#8217;s done and I&#8217;m drooped on the couch surrounded by scissors, gold paper, curly ribbon, scotch tape and loot.</p><p>And I stop for a minute to look up at the screen, and blink, then suddenly find myself weeping like a kid when I see the Grinch&#8217;s heart beam and swell and bust out of its frame &#8211; for at least the thirtieth time. And when Cindy-Lou Who gives the dog a slice of roast beast&#8230; I fall apart.</p><p>Later I&#8217;ll go down to the living room and plug in the tree, sit in the darkness of a perfect cold winter night and stare and the lights&#8230; marvelling at the power of myths and human contradiction, and maybe that share of raw innocence that I&#8217;m apparently reluctant to shed.</p></p></td></tr></table>
