	<p>The Bender Hammerling Group, Public Relations:</p>

	<blockquote>The hands on involvement provided by our firm&#8217;s principals cannot be matched by firms serving a larger client base.

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/690/rage" title="Permanent link to this article">Rage</a> &#183; 5 March 03</h3>
	<p>Well gosh, <a href="http://ragingcow.com/" title="">best of luck</a> with the viral marketing thing there, Dr Pepper/Seven Up (DPSU). I think if I were handed the problem of how to get word out about &#8216;extreme milk&#8217; that&#8217;s the road I&#8217;d take. It just <em>feels</em> right.</p>

	<p>Here in the land of cheese-eating surrender monkeys (last week the Chirac government issued mandatory t-shirts carrying the slogan &#8216;anti-American, PoMo, MultiCulti and mocking your fat ass&#8217;) they&#8217;ve been selling nuked milk for years &#8211; in fact it&#8217;s hard to find any fresh stuff past the aisles of hideous, plasticky milk in cardboard boxes at room temperature, with expiry dates generations away, owing to all that mad cow business.</p>

	<p>Oh, wait&#8230;</p>
 

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/631/placing" title="Permanent link to this article">Placing</a> &#183; 20 November 02</h3>
	<p>Upon recovery from a bit of cred squidginess following yesterday&#8217;s gush over a commercial software product, it occurs to me that, somewhere in the gaping void that is the revenue model for this site, there lie previously ignored promotion possibilities of potential benefit to all. It is at best fiscally irresponsible &#8211; at worst it is thinking inside the box &#8211; to let such opportunities go untapped. </p>

	<p>Given the ease with which <a href="http://www.ad-mkt-review.com/public_html/air/ai200008.html" title="Advertising &amp; Marketing Review">virtual product placements</a> are retroactively added to TV shows and movies, why would it not follow that such brand connections could be formed on these pages, to which several thousand people click every single day? Modifications of extant postings to suit the needs of innovative advertisers are only a couple of regular expressions away.</p>

	<p>Just consider the many ways in which <a href="/article/468/" title="The War Against Terror">mopey preening</a> can be given timeliness and vitality through <a href="/article/468/?ads=yep">subtly invasive placement</a>.</p>

	<p>The past exists to be exploited. The possibilities are many, and the prices are negotiable. Ambitious and forward-thinking account planners (US and multinat brands only, please) may contact me at the usual addresses.</p>


<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/481/loyal" title="Permanent link to this article">Loyal</a> &#183; 22 March 02</h3>
	<p>You know how the account planners and ad hacks have been bouncing around these ideas of brand ecstasy: they write long essays about the anthropology of consumer desire, about the structured intimacy of clarifying one&#8217;s own image and choosing a life path while picking up a few things at the supermarket. Well of course it&#8217;s galling. It&#8217;s irritating that any twerp anywhere can quantify/qualify your own desire when it&#8217;s so freaking hard just to make up your mind when presented with a display of goddamned <em>chocolate bars</em> at the 7&#8211;11. Not that that&#8217;s been an issue lately, but still.</p>

	<p>Even more galling, duh, is when it works. Amidst the below-mentioned gardening frenzy I&#8217;ve found myself falling head over heels for a brand, and a crashingly unsexy one at that. <a href="http://www.gardena.co.uk">Gardena</a> makes form-follows-function gardening tools, all designed quite smartly, built to last, affordable. Aisles at the <em>bricolage</em> stores teem with teal and grey and orange gadgets that all interlock and look really neat and just make sense to the upstart peckerwood green thumb like me. I sometimes pause while my brain froths away over some junk (no matter the context, not even in the garden) and I think, you know, this would be much easier with a snappy new tool made by Gardena. And my eyes cast upward, and I smile.</p>

	<p>Or it could just be that I like a brand with my name in it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/466/blocking-ads-in-os-x" title="Permanent link to this article">Blocking Ads in OS X</a> &#183; 27 February 02</h3>
	<p>Someone had to figure this out eventually. Many people have written to inquire if I knew of a way to block web advertising using a Hosts file in Macintosh OS X, &#224; la the <a href="http://www.textism.com/resources/index.html?id=5" title="Textism &#8250; Single Serving &#8250; Blocking Ads">method that worked so well in OS9</a>. It is possible but not really recommended: as the list of offending ad servers grows ever longer, the size of the Hosts file becomes so large that lookups can take forever, which is a problem when loading a page with multiple ads.</p>

	<p>Enter an admirable individual named Damien Gallop, who has written clear and careful <a href="http://www.macwrite.com/criticalmass/mac-os-x-hosts-revisited.php" title="Mac OS X Hosts Revisited">tutorials</a> on installing a Hosts file in OS X, and on the far preferable method of using the NetInfo Manager&#8217;s database of hosts to redirect requests for advertising.</p>

	<p>It takes a good ten minutes to watch the dummy entries for the ad servers be created in the Terminal window, but the time passes pleasurably: I found myself getting all warm and misty as I saw <em>ClickZ</em> and <em>DoubleClick</em> and, yes, <em>X10</em> zip by, each line meaning multiple blanked ads in the future, and, possibly somewhere, great discomfort to a twerp in a goatee and three-button suit.</p>
