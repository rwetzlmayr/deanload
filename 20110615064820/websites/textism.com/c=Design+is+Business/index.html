	<h3><a href="/article/732/Stalin8217sBulletList" title="Permanent link to this article">Stalin&#8217;s Bullet List</a> &#183; 3 June 03</h3>
	<blockquote>Imagine a widely used and expensive prescription drug that claimed to make us beautiful but didn&#8217;t. Instead the drug had frequent, serious side effects: making us stupid, degrading the quality and credibility of our communication, turning us into bores, wasting our colleagues&#8217; time. The side effects, and the resulting unsatisfactory cost/benefit ratio, would rightly lead to a worldwide product recall.<br />
&#8212;from Edward Tufte&#8217;s new leaflet, <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/436295572/tufte/books_pp" title="">The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint</a>, which just came in the mail.</blockquote>

	<p>Edward Tufte must be up there with David Foster Wallace and Stephen Hawking on the list of authors whose books are reflexively snapped up by their intended audience, yet rarely read. Most every corporate design shop in the English-speaking world keeps Tufte hardcovers on conspicuous display in studio and waiting area; mention of his name can divide a room of creative humans between those out-snorting each other with derision and those betraying the sort of baffled reverence given to an abrasively sarcastic deity.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not that the books don&#8217;t <em>try</em> to be read: each is a virtuoso performance of modern book work, impeccably typeset and laid out, stubbornly free of compromise and concessions to the bottom line. I&#8217;ve never been fond of their shape, but that&#8217;s me. The arguments are strong and elegantly presented, with Tufte&#8217;s central, ongoing (and, here, vastly reduced) theme &#8211; that data deserves unencumbered presentation &#8211; ringing out in example after glowing example.</p>

	<p>But as perfectly logical as his methods are, and as illuminating as his comparisons can be, Tufte&#8217;s advice usually has little relevance to a designer working in the arena of business, where the impulses of competition lead to work that first distinguishes the brand or the designer, and where the pressure and speed of money leave little room for the &#8216;design, think, design, think some more&#8217; approach in which Tufte passionately believes, yet which ironically leaves open canyons of room for the <span class="caps">BOGSAT </span>(bunch of guys sitting around a table) approach that is the gravitational force of commercial design.</p>

	<p>But the books are lovely to flip through while, oh, waiting for the steamer to adjust from espresso to milk setting.</p>

	<p><cite>The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint</cite>, 24 self-covered pages to tide us over until Tufte&#8217;s next book, <cite>Beautiful Evidence</cite>, looks to be similarly unlikely to budge too many people from bad design habits, like the millions now working up presentations in PowerPoint (AutoContent is just too killer an app, and don&#8217;t forget WordArt). But, as a hilarious collection of pot-shots at the ludicrous meatgrinder of ideas that is PowerPoint, it is one satisfying read. The data is of course unimpeachable, and the examples are exactly right, but one wishes the key points were presented in a breezier style, like, oh, a bulleted list, with some lively colours and graphics. Ahem.</p>

	<p>If I were to grouse, there&#8217;s Tufte&#8217;s usual tendency to downplay the significance of words and their meaning in design, preferring to evaluate data as something to be appreciated more on its visual gestures rather than the concurrent swirl of visual-textual meaning that must be parsed by those seeing information for the first time.</p>

	<p>Get it. It&#8217;s only seven bucks. You have to love that he gives over the entire centre spread to Peter Norvig&#8217;s <a href="http://www.norvig.com/Gettysburg/" title="">Gettysburg PowerPoint Presentation</a></p>

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/713/ForMusterMark" title="Permanent link to this article">For Muster Mark</a> &#183; 8 April 03</h3>
	<p>My pal John Gruber has posted a clarifying <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2003/04/translation.html" title="">translation of a recent press release</a> from Quark Inc., publishers of the page layout application Quark Xpress. It&#8217;s funny.</p>

	<p>When I began doing book design in the early Nineties there were a number of programs conducive to book-length projects, but really only two worked well to bridge the gap between designers working on Macintoshes and the filmsetting houses that output their work: Aldus Pagemaker and Quark Xpress. This isn&#8217;t to say that these weren&#8217;t lousy programs; both steered the designer toward features that seemed to exist for no reason other than that they could: the Postscript page rendering language made possible all kinds of layering, filtering, stroking, distorting, shading, filling and deliberate buggering up of text and image, all of which were placed right in the line of sight of the person clicking around until things sort of looked right. And use them they did, use them they sure did.</p>

	<p>Neither application even pretended to give two hoots about the time-honed standards of good typography, and both remained persistently shackled to one of the most foresight-free computer standards ever devised, the Type 1 Postscript font. Almost twenty years old, this format still rules print production, and this sucks, of which more in a moment.</p>

	<p>Pagemaker, a crash-prone beast with a counterintuitive interface and slow as molasses in winter, was eventually bought by Adobe, whereupon everyone stopped using it and its unofficial name (&#8216;Pagefucker&#8217;) took on common usage. This sent Quark flinging toward its destiny: to become a hostile monopoly spinning around in circles of pointless development, embracing dead-end technologies only to abandon customers once profitability proved unlikely, hobbling their own products with draconian antipiracy measures, signing unbendable licensing agreements in blood with newspaper chains, joining up with enemy Adobe to squish Quickdraw <span class="caps">GX </span>(one of many promising standards that actually showed a glimpse, at great development cost, of how sophisticated graphic design on computers could be before withering and dying once Quark said no thanks), and of course pissing off customers who paid a fortune for the privilege. And still it made horribly, horribly typeset pages.</p>

	<p>I wonder if somewhere there&#8217;s a support group for people to get together and work through feelings that linger on from dealing with Quark tech support in the years 1994&#8211;1997. Maybe one for EfiColor, too.</p>

	<p>But the killer for me was Opentype. After years of stupid adherence to the stupid Postscript Type 1 stupid font format &#8211; in which a type designer&#8217;s work is made marginally more useful than it would be if it where chiselled onto the arms of a manual typewriter, so long as the person using the typewriter worked only in North American english (elsewise, you understand, other typewriters would need to be purchased) and is subject to the letterspacing whims and lively mangling gewgaws central to programs like Quark Xpress &#8211; a new standard emerged some time ago, called Opentype; it features almost unlimited character sets and adheres to a universal character-encoding standard, it allows for sophisticated spacing and metrics, and extensive type families are available as single binary files that work the same on Windows and Macintosh computers.</p>


	<p>Quark&#8217;s still not supporting it. Nothing in the press release that John translated indicates they plan to.</p>

	<p>Well, hey, after all, no big deal, it&#8217;s just text.</p>

	<p>Adobe eventually came up with a project, codenamed K2, code-codenamed &#8216;Quark Killer&#8217;, now called Indesign. It&#8217;s good. It has native support for Opentype. Nobody uses it.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE </span>Awright lay off already. I know <em>some</em> people use Indesign &#8211; I&#8217;m one of them. But with Quark bicycling along at over 90% market share, and with predictable resistance to change in production departments everywhere, you&#8217;ll be reading crap text settings for a long time to come.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.the5k.org/" title="the5k.org : home page">It&#8217;s not me</a>: I finished judging entries last week (though just the idea of me pointing to the timely completion of anything sets off such a roar of distant laughter I probably shouldn&#8217;t even ... oh never mind).</p>

	<p>Going through the 5k competition entries I had fun, but was struck by how many were assembled with a seeming desire to cram as much <em>stuff</em> as possible into a small space. I suppose this is familiar nature-abhors-a-vacuum thinking &#8211; find a space and fill it &#8211; such as informs so much design. Just the process of finding out if it&#8217;s possible to boot a Unix kernel or play a round of Tomb Raider in under 5 kilobytes would, I imagine, make for an appealing challenge. As a viewer, however, time and again I was required to stop and marvel at crafty concessions to limited space, as though the summary statement was, &#8216;look how I can simulate a warehouse in a closet&#8217;; one which makes a curious demand on the audience: to overcome wondering why it was done at all.</p>

	<p>Scarce, I thought, were designers who embraced the smallness; who looked it in the eye and, instead of squinting, tried to imagine what good could come if such a space was all that was ever made available to them. Those who see that every container, no matter the size, can give only a portion of itself to the carriage of something else, and that (for want of a better word) <em>appropriate</em> presentation tends not to do well in crowded conditions.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.the5k.org/description.asp/entry_id=568" title="the5k.org : entries : The Book of Five Rings">The Book of Five Rings</a> and <a href="http://www.the5k.org/description.asp/entry_id=678" title="the5k.org : entries : My life in 5k">My Life in 5k</a> are two splendid entries from last year&#8217;s competition, unmatched this year.</p>

	<p>Er, it&#8217;s not just what is there, or what is said, it&#8217;s also that which goes unspoken, and that which forms itself around the visible.</p>

	<p>Trying to think of an analogy better to sum this up, I considered public speech: an orator who tries to fill one minute with an hour of ideas is going to get none of them across; a speaker who has a minute worth of content with which to fill an hour has the chance to render it myriad beautiful and ugly ways, to test the depths of proportion and frame, to render, perhaps, a narrative. Or to be as lifeless and boring as this paragraph. Something like that.</p>

	<p>Having heard there was a bit of a design debacle to be found at the web site for British Telecom&#8217;s &#163;6 million &#8216;Connected Earth&#8217; exhibit &#8211; through which a bunch of crap from BT&#8217;s corporate archives is to be elevated to the status of the Smithsonian collection &#8211; I decided to <a href="http://www.connected-earth.com">take a look</a>. Maybe you can get in to see the show; however, while attempting entry with IE5.1 and a full complement of modern plugins (Flash 5, Quicktime, <span class="caps"><acronym title="Windows Media Player">WMP</acronym></span>), I was informed that I needed to have IE5.1, Flash 5, Quicktime, and <span class="caps">WMP</span> if I hoped to get inside, then promptly forwarded to <a href="http://www.connected-earth.com/fe/config/notCompatible.html" title="http://www.connected-earth.com/...ompatible.html">this rather brusque page</a>. </p>
