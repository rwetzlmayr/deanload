	<p>Still groggy, not yet on solid food but entirely capable of outpulling a mule team, and plainly glad to be home.</p>

	<p>We&#8217;re very grateful for the notes and stories you&#8217;ve sent, and for the many donations, which will go a long way to help cover the vet bills.</p>

	<p>Whew.</p>
 

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>Volvulus <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/750/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">POSTED 13 DAYS AGO</span></h3>
	<p>It was late in the afternoon yesterday, when, slowly at first, Oliver began to complain. He moped about, walking slowly, but didn&#8217;t seem to have pain or distress. For the first time since the all-consuming maw of Hugo came along and mealtime became suddenly competitive, he didn&#8217;t finish his dinner. Then came groaning, then whimpering. Occasionally he&#8217;d start one of those full-body convulsions that dogs have when they&#8217;re about to throw up, but nothing came of it.</p>

	<p>He refused of course to verbalise what the problem was, opting instead to stare. Patting him on the side I could feel that the area beneath his ribcage was distended. Ah, then, he must have gorged himself stupid after clawing open the kibble barrel, or drank too much water, and, in any case, must really need to go outside.</p>

	<p>The 40 kilos of hyperactive weimaraner at whom I ordinarily spend a good chunk of any walk yelling (<em>you must calm the hell down</em>), once out of doors, would only pace, his legs stiff and splayed, head held low. We went quietly home.</p>

	<p>Nothing came of a quick glance through <a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=1-0876052014-7" title="">this book</a>: no index entries for <em>swollen stomach</em> or <em>stomach swollen</em> (I should have looked under <em>bloat</em>). By now Oliver had climbed the stairs to where we sleep, something he just doesn&#8217;t do in the daytime.</p>

	<p>What would you have done? This is the sort of thing that passes with time, no? I&#8217;d decided this must be the sort of thing that passes with time when, not really thinking, I picked up the vet handbook again. It fell open to Chapter 9, &#8216;The Digestive System&#8217;.</p>

	<blockquote><em>The classic signs of bloat (<a href="http://www.animalhealthchannel.com/gdv/" title="">volvulus</a>) are restlessness and pacing, salivation, retching, unproductive attempts to vomit and enlargement of the abdomen &#8230; The dog appears lethargic, obviously uncomfortable, walks in a stiff-legged fashion, hangs his head, but may not look extremely anxious or distressed &#8230; In all cases where there is the slightest suspicion of bloat, take your dog at once to a veterinary hospital. Time is of the essence.</em></blockquote>

	<p>Then Gail was on the phone, then we were in the car.</p>

	<blockquote><em>Bloat is a life-threatening emergency that affects dogs in the prime of life. The mortality rate for gastric volvulus approaches 50 percent.</em></blockquote>

	<p>Lucky that I took a second look at the book; unbelievably freaking lucky that on a Sunday evening in a rather rural corner of the South C&#233;vennes there&#8217;s an animal hospital, with a vet on standby, just fifteen minutes away in Quissac.</p>

	<blockquote><em>necrosis &#8230; organ rupture &#8230; ventricular arrhythmia</em></blockquote>

	<p>I drove fast, trying and failing to shout down the grim chorus of whatifs that began clattering in my head once I put the vet book down. Was not ready for this. Was not expecting this no sir. Oliver in the back seat, Gail beside, calming.</p>

	<p>He was going into shock by the time we got to the hospital. This was in fact some serious shit. The assistant told us of dogs with volvulus who die within an hour. The vet was brusque: after the x-ray (not pretty) he said there was no choice but to operate.</p>

	<p>Then there was the steel table, Oliver shaking. Gail dealing with forms. Me, starting to lose it, trying to keep Oliver steady (<em>it&#8217;s okay buddy it&#8217;s okay</em>) as the needle went in, letting slip blood, and the IV was hooked up, and the anti-shock drugs followed the antibiotics. The vet listed what they&#8217;d do during the operation (really not pretty), some of the risks, and we were told to go home. They would call. He walked us to the door.</p>

	<p>Pause.</p>

	<p>Thing is, you see, I&#8217;ve never lost anybody. As part of the gleaming green bracelet of impossibly good luck that exists to counterbalance my black bolt of explosively bad luck (there seems to be no middle ground) I&#8217;ve never experienced the death of anyone to whom I was really close. At this (dealing with it, preparing for it) I am a total beginner.</p>

	<p>Long pause. Phone.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;ll be a special diet from now on &#8211; no more smoked pig ears, no more salami &#8211; but otherwise it looks like he&#8217;ll be fine. We <a target="_blank" href="/oliver/cage.html" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'popupwindow', 'width=375,height=500,scrollbars,resizable'); return false;">picked him up</a> from the animal hospital this morning to <a target="_blank" href="/oliver/transport.html" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'popupwindow', 'width=375,height=500,scrollbars,resizable'); return false;">take him</a> to our regular vet, where he will stay <a target="_blank" href="/oliver/vet.html" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'popupwindow', 'width=500,height=375,scrollbars,resizable'); return false;">under observation</a> for a few days.</p>

	<p>I suppose it&#8217;ll be just a matter of time before accusations of rigging and taint cloud the air, before the burbling Attack Runts shit their collective underpants because InstaPoobah or &#8216;<a href="http://lilekswatch.blogspot.com/" title="">that hateful and nostalgic little monkey</a>&#8217; aren&#8217;t nominated, but it&#8217;s interesting nonetheless to learn that this site&#8217;s daily <a href="/oliver/daily/" title="">photos</a> of my dog Oliver (updated each day at 6 AM <span class="caps">CET</span> unless of course I forgot to put one up the night before which does happen now and again) are in the running for <a href="http://www.photojunkie.org/photobloggies/" title="">Best Pet Photo Blog</a> in the Photobloggies, an award that comes with a prize of a Red Rubber Devil Duck. No idea what that is, but it sounds pretty good.</p>

	<p>Big day for Oliver all around, as <a href="/oliver/pedigree.html" title="">this</a> arrived in the mail. He is now officially sanctioned (indeed, &#8216;highly recommended&#8217;) to bump nasties with hot bitches for money or bacon or what have you. </p>

	<p>A small private celebration, with ground beef and ear scratches, took place at midday.</p>

	<p>With the appearance of the <a href="http://www.textism.com/oliver/daily/?d=393" title="">cone of shame</a> in today&#8217;s Oliver Daily, notes have come in from persons concerned for some reason with the wellbeing of my dog&#8217;s goolies.</p>

	<p>His goolies remain. Actually there&#8217;s been talk of breeding the big goof. He just got a nick on his side from some barbed wire, hence for the next week he&#8217;ll take a break from looking perpetually mopey and put-upon in order to spend it looking like <a href="http://www.textism.com/oliver/coneofshame.html" title="">this</a>.</p>
 

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>The Lip <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/665/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">POSTED 247 DAYS AGO</span></h3>
	<p>Yesterday&#8217;s <a href="/oliver/daily/?d=380" title="">Daily Oliver</a> might seem at a casual glance to be unremarkable, however it marks the first appearance in this long ongoing project of what hereabouts is referred to as &#8216;the lip&#8217;. </p>

	<p>(Occasionally, after a rousing session of barking like an idiot at nothing in particular, or a good long slurp-and-dribble from his water bowl, or an attempt at fitting a cat&#8217;s head entirely in his maw, Oliver&#8217;s lip will end up sort of curled in, tucked back against his teeth, and what is usually a regal if sad face suddenly looks just really funny).</p>

	<p>I have debated with Herself about the lip on numerous occasions. Where I find it silly &#8211; tending to reach out and clop the dog gently on the side of his muzzle until the lip returns to normal &#8211; she enjoys it, finding entertainment and humour in such disfiguration. I respect my girlfriend&#8217;s opinion more than anyone else alive, and as such it brings some sadness to note that, after heated discussions on the lip and its value in our life, we have simply agreed to disagree, lipwise.</p>

	<p>(The above goes a long way to illustrate that which runs through the mind of a man awash in the bug-and-glitch miasma that is preparing a web application for release).</p>
