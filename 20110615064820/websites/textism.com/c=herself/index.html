	<p>Neither as a spectacle of entertainment, nor as a thing to run away and join, I&#8217;ve never understood the circus. I think we went as a family to one when I was a kid, but in memory it was loud and scarily dark. And nothing in adulthood has led me to wonder why there wasn&#8217;t more circus in it: I spent the relevant passage of <cite>Wings of Desire</cite> wondering why Peter Falk was in the movie. What after all are a tent and some animals and men dressed as clowns compared to the rich reward of hours spent feasting on sweet, opiate television or clicking from one blogroll to the next, or dozing with a fat novel on your face. I ask you.</p>

	<p>Having spent most every nonhorizontal moment of the last few months ensnared in the Project at Hand &#8211; scowling at a computer screen, blaspheming all the while &#8211; it barely registered when a few weeks ago Herself mentioned that an Italian circus was coming to Montpellier, and that she&#8217;d ordered tickets.</p>

	<p>Okaygreatsoundsgood. Clicky clicky scowl scowl.</p>

	<p>And boom came the day, yesterday. I was noisily extracted from the computer and, with the little redhaired kid and the formidable daughter nattering in the back seat, we rolled like hillbillies to the state fair, down through and past Montpellier, to the Parc des Expositions, out by the airport.</p>

	<p>(You know that day when, for the first time since the previous autumn, you put your hand out the car window and feel no bite in the air? That was yesterday.)</p>

	<p>Popcorn needs were met, into the big tent and we were seated. Trapeze artists, acrobats, gymnasts, a juggler; mercifully only one clown. People standing on galloping horses, small shetlands moving in unison, elephants. No tigers. A woman who swung five steel hoops at differing rates on her hips. Fire breathing, fire juggling, the throwing of knives on fire. Other than the occasional bit of synth fizzing out of the loudspeakers (and, I suppose, the loudspeakers), there were practically no concessions to modern entertainment: just physical skill and timing, and too much eye makeup.</p>

	<p>I loved each and every minute of it. Except for the irritating woman who had some sort of problem with us taking their front row seats at intermission (you want impressive, you should see Herself curse someone out in French), it was a perfect day out.</p>

	<p>Pictures? <a href="/photos/?s=36" title="">Surely</a>.</p>

	<p>Sure, sure, she&#8217;s smart and beautiful and all that, but how could you not love a woman who sends you out into the world with a grocery list like <a href="http://www.textism.com/bucket/grocery.html" title="The Grocery List">this</a>?</p>

	<p>Many of you are familiar with the <a href="http://openbrackets.com/" title="Open Brackets">work of my girlfriend</a>, the redoubtable Gail Armstrong, yes? She being the dishy woman of awesome accomplishment and talent who managed somehow to turn me into a less miserable prick? That is her. She&#8217;s celebrating a birthday today. It&#8217;s one of those faintly unsettling round-number birthdays, though she seems to be taking it in stride, mostly settled. </p>

	<p>Why not <a href="mailto:armstrong@openbrackets.com?subject=Happy Birthday">send her a note</a>, something nice. She&#8217;d like that.</p>

	<p>One full day after viewing <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0100486" title="Reversal of Fortune (1990)">Reversal of Fortune</a> on television, I am still chuckling &#38; lurching about, doing Jeremy Irons: <em>...and a vaaal of inshulin. Jusht kidding...,</em> and cracking wise:</p>

	<blockquote>&#8212;I think we should cultivate a Claus-and-Sunny kind of relationship.</blockquote>

	<p>Herself does not even pause:</p>

	<blockquote>&#8212;Oh yeah, which one do you want to be?</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s just gone Christmas here, this house standing quiet in the dark, crackling snow lingering outside; beside me Herself folded into a lovely warm curl of sleep while the television rattles on; Oliver over there, one eye open, calculating that tomorrow it&#8217;ll be lamb kidneys instead of kibble.</p>

<p>I want only sleep. And none of this to end, ever.</p>

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>Alright <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/400/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">POSTED 666 DAYS AGO</span></h3>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have to point out that dancing like a fool to <i>The Velvet Underground and Nico</i> with Herself in the main room of a three hundred year old stone house in the South of France in the middle of November, full of beef stew and strong wine and laughing so much, with a Weimaraner puppy scrambling underfoot, and all the other stuff (all of it, oh man): I&#8217;m going to have to point out that this is good.</p>

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>Night Air <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/352/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">POSTED 725 DAYS AGO</span></h3>
<p>We held our first dinner party with neighbours on Saturday night, with requisite anxieties beforehand over required quantities of this and that and how many lamb chops and one salad or two. I got another crash course on <i>vous</i> and <i>tu</i> protocol, and on who should be offered drinks, and when.</p>

<p>Vero and Luc (elementary school <i>directrice</i> and hang-gliding instructor, respectively) arrived with their brood and a huge bowl of <i>cr&#232;me anglaise</i> (dubbed for the moment <i>cr&#232;me canadienne</i>), and I experienced my first flurry of rapid fire cheek-kissing, handshakes and presentations before all protocol evaporated and we went on to have a really rather good time. The kids anaesthetized in front of the TV, we talked politics and books, bitched out the European union, and told rude jokes requiring no translation.</p>

<p>The huge platter of marinated raw meat (soy sauce, mustard, rosemary) was ceremoniously paraded out to the yard, and Luc held the portable light while I turned chops on the grill and bullshitted in boozy franglais about the proper use of convection heat in coal preparation and Canadian Extreme Barbecuing, and he smiled indulgently and it was all male-bondy and shit.</p>

<p>Stacking dishes, afterward. Artie Shaw on the stereo. I am happy and in love. </p>

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>Here and Now <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/345/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">POSTED 733 DAYS AGO</span></h3>
<p>Ever since that <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/author%3DMayle%2C%20Peter/202-4237017-9952616" title="Peter Mayle">loathsome adman</a> ruined travel writing (and possibly travel) forever with an endless stream of precious wank about nobly amusing Proven&#231;als and orgies of yuppie-sanitized gastronomy (&#8220;It was like tasting sunshine&#8221;), the South of France has been lousy with loathsome admen and their tense, reedy wives on ever more expansive quests for the adorably rustic.</p>

<p>Happily, it seems this part of the Languedoc-Rousillon has been spared the onslaught of rented beemers and J. Crew ballcaps, likely because everything here is quite marvellously unfabulous. Pompignan is small and plain: one boulangerie, one bar-tabac, lots and lots of vineyards; its only landmark is a pretty church with a steeple that, from our bedroom window, seems to shoot a dagger of black light into the night sky.</p>

<p>I grilled steaks over wood fire in the garden last night &#8211; Woody Herman blasting through open windows &#8211; while she snipped herbs and opened wine, and we ate on the terrace as the sun went down. Surely similar scenes played out in Des Moines and Etobicoke, but who cares.</p>

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>J&#8217;arrive <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/344/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">POSTED 737 DAYS AGO</span></h3>
<p>Long airport lines and sad goodbyes notwithstanding, air travel was relatively painless: I lucked into a seat in an empty four-pack on the transatlantic flight, and stretched out in scotch- and Ativan-heavy sleep the whole way.</p>

<p>Herself met me at Heathrow, and we flew Air France to Paris (400 cellphones chirped as the plane touched down), then to Montpellier, landing at 11 pm.</p>

<p>Bombing at midnight across the countryside in her decrepit Ford, grinning like fools, the air hot and rich, the streets narrow.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a little concerned about the sudden admiration I feel for the work of Jerry Lewis and Mickey Rourke. </p>
