	<p>I&#8217;m sure all dogs do the post-nap stretching thing: hind legs stay put while front paws walk forward until chest touches ground, then a long sigh or yawn. </p>

<p>My dog Oliver does this, but &#8211; with consistency unlike any other dog I&#8217;ve met &#8211; at the moment of maximum stretch, with his ass in the air, he turns his head to look around, almost as if to make sure someone is watching, pauses a beat, then farts: sort of a quiet <em>ffit.</em></p>

	<p>Whereupon he collapses into a sphinx pose and resumes staring at whoever is in the room. After a few seconds, <em>every single time,</em> he cocks his head at an angle, looks a little alarmed, and starts to sniff the air.</p>

	<p>A Happy Thanksgiving to all.</p>

		<li>Some time ago Oliver managed to destroy this cat door in an attempt, one imagines, to get <em>through</em> it.</li>

	<p>Four more banal anecdotes about my dog:</p>

	<p><span class="caps">ONE</span><br>
	<a href="http://boingboing.net/uke/" title="Ukulelia: Your Passport to Four Stringed Para...">Ukelele</a> enthusiasts will be familiar with the tuning mnemonic &#8216;my dog has fleas&#8217;. Hereabouts &#8211; perhaps brought about by his perpetual doleful expression, perhaps by his various appetites &#8211; this has been modified to &#8216;my dog has needs&#8217;.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">TWO</span><br>
	Given the choice, he will go for a dried pig ear over a dried cow ear every time; if however no pig ears are available, a cow ear will do. Additionally, he has attached special meaning to the word &#8216;pineapple&#8217;.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">THREE</span><br>
	There&#8217;s a bit of training every day. We&#8217;re still working on a reliable <em>heel,</em> but for the most part he doesn&#8217;t pull, and he seems quite content in a <em>sit</em> or <em>down.</em> Sometimes, on a walk, he will suddenly buck and bray like a horse, jumping forward, back and to each side, before breaking into a run that requires me to make little quarter-turns as he wheels around at the end of the lead, circling like so many wagons. The appearance of the word &#8216;wagon&#8217; inevitably puts me in mind of Wagon Wheels, a sort of chocolate-marshmallow-wafer thing my mother occasionally included in my school lunch, one that had a distinct sweet smell when you tore open the opaque plastic foil. Such potent olfactory memories can lead to other, larger, constructs of mind, as old Marcel P. liked to point out, but this one ends right there.    </p>

	<p>I get a lot of mail about my dog, the photographs of my dog, the liberal coverage my dog receives on this site. Once in a while someone fires off something to the effect of &#8216;William Wegman you&#8217;re not&#8217; which is of course fine. Vastly more frequent are messages that demand, sometimes with chilly directness, &#8216;less text, more Oliver&#8217;. And who am I to rebuke their desires? Who am I to say, &#8216;take your desires and place them where the sun don&#8217;t shine.&#8217; </p>

	<p>I am not he who would say this.</p>

	<p>So here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.textism.com/oliver/daily/" title="Oliver, Daily">The Daily Oliver</a>. A new photo every day, updated at 6 <span class="caps">AM</span> Central Europe Time. There will be puppy pictures, there will be many doleful gazes, but there will be no archive.</p>

	<p>Those who would like a thumbnail view of the day&#8217;s picture picked up by their <span class="caps">RSS</span> aggregator of choice will find the necessary <span class="caps">XML</span> <a href="http://www.textism.com/oliver/daily/rss.php" title="http://www.textism.com/oliver/daily/rss.php">here</a>.</p>

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>Barns <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/536/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">25 JUNE 02</span></h3>
	<p>Four banal anecdotes about my dog:</p>

	<p><span class="caps">HE IS OUTGOING</span><br>
	When he was smaller, we would let him run free outside. His exploratory ambitions were then fairly limited, and he stayed close by. Now, of course, when he runs free we sometimes get calls from neighbours asking what he&#8217;s doing in their kitchen, causing much embarrassment and apology.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">FLEXIBLE</span><br>
	He responds to both the French (oh-lee-vair) and English (all-of-er) pronunciations of his name. He also responds to buddy, spaz, dickweed, bolliver, smolliver, bolivia, oliver-yesterdays-have-lighted-fools-the-way-to-dusty-death, dog, bon chien, connard, conrad and paws.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UP, BUT NOT DOWN</span><br>
	Access to the topmost (and busiest) floor of the house is by a very steep wooden staircase &#8211; actually it&#8217;s more like a ladder. At an early age Oliver was encouraged to climb up it, eventually hop-tugging his way to the top. He now gets up quite easily, and has all manner of fun up there, but has yet to figure out how to get down. A couple of disastrous attempts have made it terrifying even to try.</p>

	<p>And so, several times a day, he is picked up and carried &#8211; sometimes trembling, clinging tight &#8211; like a 40kg sack of potatoes down the stairs. He makes all sorts of fuss about wanting to go downstairs, notably first thing in the morning, but when one bends to pick him up he jumps around like it&#8217;s time to play a game. Funny, that. </p>

	<p><span class="caps">A THOUGHT-PROVOKING SOUND</span><br>
	Occasionally, when left alone in the house, he will howl. The first time I heard it I was in the garden &#8211; gardening &#8211; when I noticed what seemed perhaps to be the wrenching creak of a wooden structure, maybe a barn, as it began to collapse after many years of service. There are no such structures nearby, at least none that that I could remember seeing; when I finally did conclude that it was Oliver making the sound, I was interested not so much in why he was howling as I was in why, in an area so very agricultural, there was such a dearth of barns.</p>

	<p>I then realized that most all of the farming done nearby is of vineyards, whose demands as far as equipment is concerned are rather light: save for the occasional skinny tractor all the equipment required can be stored in a garage.</p>
