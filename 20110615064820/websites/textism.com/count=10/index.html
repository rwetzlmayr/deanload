	<h3><a href="/article/771/EndoftheAnimalKingdom" title="Permanent link to this article">End of the Animal Kingdom</a> &#183; 21 December 03</h3>
<p>It turns out the wackily ponderous movie made in Pompignan last year (shooting of which complained about <a href="/article/593/">here</a>, brief review by Herself of hometown showing <a href="http://www.openbrackets.com/article/515/">here</a>) isn&#8217;t going straight to TV after all &#8211; we&#8217;d heard it was going to show on Arte sometime around now &#8211; it&#8217;s been <a href="http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=47700.html">released in cinemas</a>.</p>

	<p>If you&#8217;re near a major French city and possessed of nothing better to do, you can head out see our very own little red-haired kid in his star turn as &#8220;little red-headed kid in schoolhouse&#8221;, No&#235;l the vigneron as &#8220;guy in baseball cap&#8221;, the old guy on a bicycle leading his white horse down the main street as he does every day, lots of purdy <em>haute garrigue</em> scenery, and much else besides, in a largely unsatisfying study of longing, sensuality, death and sheep. </p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not that bad. In many ways it&#8217;s like a two-hour love letter to our little village.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/770/Hardware" title="Permanent link to this article">Hardware</a> &#183; 19 December 03</h3>
<p>I like my iBook. Its name is Snowy. Here&#8217;s what it&#8217;s missing:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>A way to easily disable the caps lock key, for those of us whose large clumsy hands keep hitting it by mistake.</li>
		<li>Better yet, no caps lock at all: for such a rarely-used key it takes up inordinate space on the keyboard. You could lock and unlock caps by hitting Shift twice, no?</li>
		<li>A low-wattage FM transmitter, so audio can be played through a home stereo without mucking with jacks and cables.</li>
		<li>Somewhere else for the <span class="caps">CPU</span>. Even with <a href="http://www.roadtools.com/">ample circulation</a> the heat buildup under the heel of my left hand is <em>annoying.</em></li>
		<li>Better access to the function keys. I&#8217;m roughly four times more interested in using f-keys than I am in Expos&#233; or adjusting volume or screen brightness, yet I have to use a combination of keys to get to them.</li>
		<li>A full stop/period/dot/whatever that doesn&#8217;t require the shift key (particular to <span class="caps">AZERTY</span> keyboards but a pain nonetheless).</li>
		<li>The ability to close the screen without it going to sleep, so it can operate as an unobtrusive stereo component, server, downloader, whatever.</li>
		<li>It should sense whenever I enter the room and immediately begin playing <em>Back in Black</em> by AC/DC.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Just wanted to get that out.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Gruber</a> and others kindly point to <a href="http://gnufoo.org/ucontrol/ucontrol.html">uControl</a>, a kernel hack that solves the caps lock and fkey problems and appears to pick up dry cleaning as well. It behaved a bit flakily when first installed, owing to a lack of 10.3.2 updating on my part.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE 2</span>: I was joking, but several people wrote to say that with a combination of a Bluetooth adapter, a Sony/Ericsson shoe phone and <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/jonassalling/Shareware/Clicker/">this</a> freakish innovation, I can in fact have <em>Back in Black</em> begin to play whenever I enter the room. God blind me.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE 3</span>: It might be noted that in the original Tintin, Snowy is called <em>Milou.</em> Thomson and Thompson are <em>Dupont et Dupond.</em> Freaking Belgians.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE 4</span>: Oh! Oh! I forgot the most important missing thing of all &#8211; a way to turn off the damned glowing <span class="caps">HEY I</span>&#8217;<span class="caps">M</span> REALLY <span class="caps">ASLEEP</span> light that, in the pitch-black rural night, can seem like a neon motel sign forever blinking <em>vacancy.</em> </p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE 5</span>: Screw the iBook &#8211; <a href="http://www.leatherman.com/products/tools/wave/">this is the best thing ever</a>.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE 6</span>: There is no update 6.</p>

<p>Boiled carrots &#8211; woody, mushy, bland &#8211; are crotchspawn of the devil. Glazed carrots are prizey, the business, the shit.</p>

	<p>One prefers of course the small, sweet early-summer carrots which require only a quick scrub under the tap, and which can be served with a sprig of greens left on. In their absence regular supermarket carrots will do, as long as the ones you use are fairly uniform in size. If they are spongey or resemble balsa wood when cut open, chuckem.</p>

	<p>If you&#8217;re using supermarket carrots, pare them at each end. You&#8217;ll want to get the bitter outer layer off: you can scrub with a vegetable brush, or you can scrape with the edge of a sharp knife, or you can use a peeler. If you choose the latter, you had better do it right. </p>

	<p>Some will rotate the carrot with one hand, peeling rapidly in a sort of card-dealing motion. Not only is this imprecise, it causes carrot peel to fly all over the place and I hate that.</p>

	<p>Regard the palm of your non-dominant hand and firmly situate the carrot between your thumb and fingertips. Position the peeler so its two blades sit astride the squared-off corner of the end opposite. Using decisive forearm motion, draw the peeler backward until it glides entirely off. A long thin strip of peel should <em>come away with</em> the peeler; you are thus afforded a measure of control over its destiny. Rotate the carrot enough to begin anew and &#8211; this is the pleasing part &#8211; the very act of positioning the peeler on the opposite end of the carrot will cut free the existing strip from its blades; the strip will then fall gently to the cutting board like a cooked noodle.</p>

	<p>Once peeled, you can slice. Some like to cut their carrots at a jaunty angle, but anywhere other than asian restaurants this is merely cute. Slice at a right angle to the length of the carrot, adjusting for width so the <em>total mass</em> of each slice is consistent: slices from a narrow part will be longer, etc..</p>

	<p>You should have some white or brown meat stock going. You can dissolve a cube in boiling water if you have to.</p>

	<p>Arrange the carrots in single layer in a heavy pan, with enough stock to just cover. Add salt and pepper (go on then), a good-sized fling of brown sugar, and a walnut or so of butter.</p>

	<p>Cook, uncovered, at a gentle boil, for about half an hour, checking now and again if the carrots are becoming soft; if so, you may need to pour off some of the liquid in the rush to completion. Mushiness here is a mark of abject failure.</p>

	<p>When the liquid is all but evaporated, crank up the heat so the butter and sugars in the sauce can carmelize and coat the carrots. </p>

	<p>Serve, dusted with chopped fresh parsley, in a dish or bowl or something.</p>
