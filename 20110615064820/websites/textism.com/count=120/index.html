	<h3><a href="/article/628/" title="Permanent link to this article">Servicing</a> - 15 November 02</h3>
	<p>His beard flecked with the semen of hideous and powerful men, <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/components/printstory/printstory.asp?id=152595D2-E492-4AC4-B104-D3D8DA8A19C2" title="NATIONAL POST">Mark Steyn</a> continues to lick at the air:</p>

	<blockquote>If we&#8217;ve learned anything since September 11th, it&#8217;s that, if it were left to the multilateral acronyms &#8211; the UN, EU, even <span class="caps">NATO</span> &#8211; al-Qaeda would have the run of the planet. </blockquote>

	<p>That anyone <em>anywhere</em> is so stupid as to take this laughable piece of shit seriously, with his faux-jovial giggling at the dead, his deranged fantasies of multiculturalism and gangrape, his laboured lies on behalf of those whose plan for &#8216;security&#8217; in the face of terrorism is to seize oil under the fuzzy cover of rage against wrong-thinking brown people, his munificent and forgiving massages of hatred among neocon sheep, is beyond me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/627/" title="Permanent link to this article">Dies Irae</a> - 13 November 02</h3>

<a href="/index.php?parentid=627" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'popupwindow', 'width=500,height=500,scrollbars,resizable,status'); return false;">So what&#8217;s pissing you off today?</a> <span class="caps">[231]</span>
<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/626/" title="Permanent link to this article">Salad (Caesar)</a> - 11 November 02</h3>
	<p>Buy romaine lettuce only. Anything less rigid will wilt too quickly; anything sturdier, i.e., kale, is not salad. Fill the sink half full of cold water. Tear the lettuce how you like, but remind yourself in doing so that pieces large enough to require cutting with a knife before eating won&#8217;t win you any friends. Remove any lettuce that is brown or skanky, agitate the rest in the water, and leave it to soak for a bit. </p>

	<p>Make croutons: distribute chunks of stale bread on a cookie sheet, dribble olive oil, salt and pepper, pop under the broiler, tossing occasionally, until <em>toasty</em> but not <em>crunchy.</em> Store-bought croutons are for the idle.</p>

	<p>Drain the lettuce and spin, or, in the absence of a spinner, place the leaves in a large tea towel, gather the four corners in your hand and make elaborate windmill motions with your arm, &#224; la Pete Townshend (without all the booze and deafness, of course), until centrifugal force does its job. </p>

	<p>You will need: a clove or two of garlic, sea salt, tinned anchovy fillets in oil (you can of course use anchovy paste or a bottled sauce, but the tinned taste less of motor oil and funk), Dijon mustard, Worcestershire, an egg (coddled for ten seconds in boiling water), half a lemon, olive oil, a chunk of Parmesan (of sufficient freshness that the cheese curls rather than crumbles when grated), black pepper, a wooden salad bowl, a whisk, and salad tongs or whatever.</p>

	<p>On a cutting board, bash the garlic with the side of a knife blade and remove the peel and anything green or brown. Chop the garlic coarsely, and then sprinkle on a pinch of sea salt (this prevents the garlic from sticking to the knife and makes the entire endeavour more pleasant). Chop a bit more, then lay the side of your knife blade against the garlic and, applying pressure with your fingertips against the blade, <em>smear</em> the garlic into the cutting board, back and forth a couple times until it liquefies.</p>

	<p>Take two anchovy fillets from the tin and give the rest to the cat. Chop these finely with the garlic, then scoop the whole mess up with your knife and fling it into the bowl.</p>

	<p>Fling in a spoonful of mustard and a couple glops of Worcestershire. Crack in the egg. Squeeze in the juice of the half lemon, pluck out the seeds, and whisk it all together. </p>

	<p>Keep whisking as you dribble in olive oil. Go slowly: you want the oil to have a chance to thicken and emulsify with the egg; elsewise the dressing will become watery and you will be cross. Check for salt, then leave it be.</p>

	<p>When it&#8217;s salad time, assemble at the table. Theatrically toss the lettuce and the dressing once or twice while carrying on a conversation, and then leap up and lob the croutons in from across the room. Stand on a chair and grate Parmesan four feet above the bowl. Toss. Run around the table grinding pepper randomly into the air as you chant <em>oh you lucky people oh you lucky people.</em> Toss. Serve.</p>


<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/625/" title="Permanent link to this article">Maintenance</a> - 10 November 02</h3>
	<p>Alert visitors to the <a href="/oliver/daily/">Oliver Daily</a> will already have noticed the appearance of a link to previous dailies. I had never planned to do this (it seemed to make sense as a time-limited offering), but the lobbying has been intense, and I am not he who will not occasionally bend to pressure.</p>

	<p>(Those to whom this means nothing: every day, for 132 days now, a new photograph of my dog Oliver has been made available on this site. I really like my dog.)</p>

	<p>Also. Newly updated is <a href="/about/">About the Author</a>: now twice as long and just as uninformative.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/624/" title="Permanent link to this article">It Went Like This</a> - 9 November 02</h3>
<p>It was at a party, the house of a friend, an early summer evening. Everybody was on the terrace off the kitchen, talking and drinking. There was a creak and a barely perceptible shift and everyone stopped talking at once as the terrace creaked some more and suddenly it collapsed, parting in the middle. Some held on to the railings while everybody else slid down as though in a coffee filter; except for Trixie, who stayed upright the whole time. When it was over she stood, drink in hand, on the ground beneath.</p>
