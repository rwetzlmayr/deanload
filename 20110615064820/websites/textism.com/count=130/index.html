<h3>Refer 1.0 <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/611/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">20 OCTOBER 02</span></h3>
	<p>I&#8217;m finally getting close to getting around to getting going on releasing some of the software I&#8217;ve alluded to over the past decade.</p>

	<p>First is <a href="/tools/refer/" title="Refer 1.0">Refer</a>, a module of the <span class="caps">CMS</span> that runs this site. Refer offers clear, up-to-the-minute tracking of incoming referrers to a web site. You can see it in action <a href="/refer/">right here</a>.</p>

	<p>Use it in good health.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: Now version 1.04. Fixed problems with internal referrer filtering and such. Details in the <a href="/tools/refer/">change log</a>.</p>

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>Herself <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/609/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">17 OCTOBER 02</span></h3>
	<p>Sure, sure, she&#8217;s smart and beautiful and all that, but how could you not love a woman who sends you out into the world with a grocery list like <a href="http://www.textism.com/bucket/grocery.html" title="The Grocery List">this</a>?</p>

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>A Simple Story <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/608/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">16 OCTOBER 02</span></h3>
	<p>I know this guy No&#235;l: a standup dude, a straight shooter, a no-bullshit kind of guy. He&#8217;s lived in Pompignan his whole life, as have several generations of his family. He speaks in the Occitan-heavy slangy drawl of the Languedoc, in which wine comes out <em>vang,</em> things that are good are <em>bang,</em> and the Village in which we live is Pompeen<em>yang.</em> He is precisely the funny-cranky but skilled misanthropic optimist that I try and fail to be.</p>

	<p>No&#235;l is the owner of about 18 hectares of vineyards that lie on either side of the road that runs into town from the North. From this road it&#8217;s plain to see that &#8211; unlike all of the other 138 members of the Pompignan wine cooperative &#8211; No&#235;l grows dense, healthy vines. Big fat grapes. The reasons for this are many: he knows what he&#8217;s doing, he works very hard, he loves what he does and &#8211; unlike the other 138 members of the Pompignan wine cooperative &#8211; he would be unsatisfied to fling a wodge of chemically fertilized garbage into the hopper every September for a cheque.</p>

	<p>After No&#235;l was named President of the wine co-op last year, he managed to shake things up quite a bit: he got them computerized (and by that I don&#8217;t mean he computerized production, he <em>got a PC for the office</em>), he hired a full-time <em>&#339;nologue</em> (who looks like Danny Kaye and makes goofy faces when sipping), and instilled a policy of actually inspecting grapes before they are weighed and pressed. Many truckloads were rejected for inferior quality. This of course made some growers mad, but for the first time in modern memory the wine was not utter crap. Medals were awarded. Labels were designed. Pallets were shipped. Future options were considered.</p>

	<p>But smalltown resentments run long, and this past summer No&#235;l was voted out as President. By September everything was fully back the way it was, the 2002 wine is crap, and the cult of mediocrity reigns once more at the Pompignan wine co-op.</p>

	<p>So No&#235;l is telling them to go fuck themselves.</p>

	<p>He&#8217;s going to build a <em>cave,</em> on his own property. He will get his own appellation. He will make very good wine. This news is recent, and it is very good.</p>

	<p>I met Rod Filbrandt once, in the mid Nineties or so, to talk about a book project in need of an illustrator. The book eventually died at the proposal stage, but still I enjoyed the meeting (at that point in life it was a pleasant surprise to meet anyone whose worldview was bleaker than my own; once, on the labels for his drawings in a gallery show, Rod had listed his medium as &#8216;ink and bourbon&#8217;). </p>

	<p>After a run of several years, he had just retired <cite>Wombat,</cite> a nihilistic, rude-funny four panel that had appeared in the <cite>Georgia Straight</cite> (Vancouver&#8217;s version of any other city&#8217;s &#8216;alternative&#8217; weekly repository of voice personals, spot advertising and <cite>Savage Love</cite>). I groused about this, but he said he was about to start a new comic, something &#8216;darker&#8217;. I asked what it would be called. <cite>Dry Shave</cite>.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s hard to pinpoint what made <cite>Dry Shave</cite> (which ran until 1999) so good. Certainly there was the stylistic hook: a sort of hungover film-noir lapsed hepcat vibe so embraced by myself and others of &#8211; for want of a less offensive term &#8211; the Coupland Demographic. And there were these characters, see, all losers, failed criminals, flatfoots, nogoodniks. Alleys, tiki lounges, coldwater flats, black humour, murder, potty jokes: everything good.</p>

	<p>There is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1895636213">book</a>, which you should buy. Some favourites from the <a href="http://www.iamthefly.com/dryshave/index.htm" title="Dry Shave">official site</a>:</p>

	<p>For quite practical (that is to say, not frivolous or completely dunderheaded) reasons, much of today was spent combing through old <span class="caps">PHP</span>, folding some layabout code into the Textism Publishing Engine (codenamed <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/" title="textpattern - writing tools for the web">Textpattern</a>), in particular the commenting system that ran here sporadically last year. Back then it was duct tape and baling wire holding it together; now the various bits have been streamlined into something resembling a cohesive whole, albeit one assembled by zealous bureaucrats on an encounter weekend &#8211; all flipcharts, Nerf Bats and tears.</p>

	<p>One big accomplishment of the day was figuring out how to prevent the resubmission of form data when a window is refreshed/reloaded. Figuring this out brought much joyful relief; so much so that I flung open the windows, inhaled deeply, hunched over, and played air guitar for thirty seconds. </p>

	<p>Anyway, it (the commenting thing) needs to be tested out, and this is where you come in. Complete, if you would, the following assertion:</p>
<a href="/index.php?parentid=604" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'popupwindow', 'width=500,height=500,scrollbars,resizable,status'); return false;">People who ___ should ___, because ___.</a> <span class="caps">[178]</span>

	<blockquote>&#8216;Pop music is probably one of the last places a conservative would normally look for reinforcement of his worldview. Rock and roll, which has dominated pop music since the 1950s, is inexorably associated with liberalism in the minds of many conservatives. But in fact, there have been a significant number of songs on the pop charts during the rock era that are explicitly conservative. <a href="http://www.townhall.com/phillysoc/bartlettpaper.htm" title="Conservative Pop Music">I have compiled a list of these conservative classics</a>.&#8217;<br>&#8212;Bruce Bartlett</blockquote>
