	<blockquote>&#8212;It&#8217;s banal, but knowing.</blockquote>

	<blockquote>&#8212;Knowing.</blockquote>

	<blockquote>&#8212;Well, knowing-but-not-really-caring. You know, like, detached and above, but not critical, or not cynical rather, kind of like embracing the whole thing, the whole product...</blockquote>

	<blockquote>&#8212;What product?</blockquote>

	<blockquote>&#8212;The product of Canada, insofar as it is filtered through a sort of, like, lovely-little-things aesthetic, you know, like things that tug gently at the memory as well as would look really kind of, like, detached and above but cool and newly hip in an installation or show or on a mantlepiece. </blockquote>

	<blockquote>&#8212;And who is the target audience?</blockquote>

	<blockquote>&#8212;Well, you know, sort of hip older people with money. From, like, the work they do.</blockquote>

	<blockquote>&#8212;And it&#8217;s mostly visual.</blockquote>

	<blockquote>&#8212;Oh yes, I have all these lovely-little-things to shoot, Inuit dolls and stubbies and souvenirs of the world&#8217;s biggest tomato, and we could reuse some of the shots from that issue of <cite>Vancouver</cite> I guest-edited. Boy, they cost a lot.</blockquote>

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>Information Technology <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/537/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">27 JUNE 02</span></h3>
	<p>This is almost entirely true. I was having problems with the Airport base station.</p>

	<p>Since last year, our little setup here (my G4 PB running OS X, and the slightly grizzled iBook using 9.2.1 that belongs to Herself) has been linked together and to the internet by an Airport wireless hub; it has thus far run fairly smoothly. Provided there&#8217;s no radio interference, it runs great.</p>

	<p>A couple weeks ago it started acting up: kept refusing to connect, and bumping offline when it did. After a while it would mock me, showing a strong network signal in the AirPort info (no interference), but reporting that its Status was Not Available. It would just hang, spinning its wheels; not assigning IP addresses over <span class="caps">DHCP</span>, not connecting to anything. And so I tried to fix it. And kept trying.</p>

	<blockquote>&#8212;I can&#8217;t connect.<br>
	&#8212;Yes, darling, I know.</blockquote>

	<p>You need to understand that this was days and days of trial and error, of a hundred thousand restarts and resets and uploading of AirPort firmware, stripping down all <span class="caps">TCP</span>/<span class="caps">IP</span> resources on three different systems, completely reinstalling one system, talking to the AirPort via telnet, Googling and searching in vain through Apple&#8217;s knowledgebase and discussions, after downloading 20-meg and 40-meg updates (available only through Apple&#8217;s lame-ass Software Update control panel; what fun that is over a <em>modem</em>).</p>

	<blockquote>&#8212;It&#8217;s saying &#8216;Status Not Available&#8217;<br>
	&#8212;Yes, I <em>know.</em></blockquote>

	<p>But at last, late the other night, after endless false starts, things seemed to be working. And seemed to keep working. I reclined, laptop on lap, and glided through a relatively eventless email check (barnyard friends, cum guzzling sluts, Nigerian investment), when it hesitated and, there off in the corner of the screen, Internet Connect was saying Status Not Available.</p>

	<p>And here you need to understand that I am not a violent man. But at that second, almost instantly, the powerbook became the human face of all the ruinous frustration, all the stomach-lurching repetitiveness of not getting it to work, and I punched they keyboard a couple times, hard enough to knock loose half a dozen keys.</p>

	<p>Fine. My bad. Breathe. Put the damn keys back on. One snapped back into place right away, two and three needed some wiggling. And then I spent the next hour and a half cursing, occasionally yelling, sweating in the airless night, trying to mash four five and six back into place. They would not take. They would not take.</p>

	<p>Finally, sick of it all and uttering the words &#8216;I am irritated&#8217; (&#8216;Yes, <em>I know&#8217;</em> came from the other room) I just let the powerbook fall, open, from my hands to the couch &#8211; a distance of maybe six inches. It turns out that six inches of free-fall provides more than enough momentum to <em>snap the fucking screen lid off its mounts,</em> rendering one G4 powerbook frankly, essentially, useless. </p>

	<p>And here you need to understand that the next day, while I was learning from an Apple technician in Montpellier that an Applecare warrantly purchased in Canada is not valid in Europe &#8211; and that, in addition, repairs of this magnitude will require that the powerbook take a lengthy sojourn in Holland &#8211; the server that hosts this site went down for fourteen and a half hours. DoS attack, so I&#8217;m told.</p>

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>Barns <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/536/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">25 JUNE 02</span></h3>
	<p>Four banal anecdotes about my dog:</p>

	<p><span class="caps">HE IS OUTGOING</span><br>
	When he was smaller, we would let him run free outside. His exploratory ambitions were then fairly limited, and he stayed close by. Now, of course, when he runs free we sometimes get calls from neighbours asking what he&#8217;s doing in their kitchen, causing much embarrassment and apology.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">FLEXIBLE</span><br>
	He responds to both the French (oh-lee-vair) and English (all-of-er) pronunciations of his name. He also responds to buddy, spaz, dickweed, bolliver, smolliver, bolivia, oliver-yesterdays-have-lighted-fools-the-way-to-dusty-death, dog, bon chien, connard, conrad and paws.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UP, BUT NOT DOWN</span><br>
	Access to the topmost (and busiest) floor of the house is by a very steep wooden staircase &#8211; actually it&#8217;s more like a ladder. At an early age Oliver was encouraged to climb up it, eventually hop-tugging his way to the top. He now gets up quite easily, and has all manner of fun up there, but has yet to figure out how to get down. A couple of disastrous attempts have made it terrifying even to try.</p>

	<p>And so, several times a day, he is picked up and carried &#8211; sometimes trembling, clinging tight &#8211; like a 40kg sack of potatoes down the stairs. He makes all sorts of fuss about wanting to go downstairs, notably first thing in the morning, but when one bends to pick him up he jumps around like it&#8217;s time to play a game. Funny, that. </p>

	<p><span class="caps">A THOUGHT-PROVOKING SOUND</span><br>
	Occasionally, when left alone in the house, he will howl. The first time I heard it I was in the garden &#8211; gardening &#8211; when I noticed what seemed perhaps to be the wrenching creak of a wooden structure, maybe a barn, as it began to collapse after many years of service. There are no such structures nearby, at least none that that I could remember seeing; when I finally did conclude that it was Oliver making the sound, I was interested not so much in why he was howling as I was in why, in an area so very agricultural, there was such a dearth of barns.</p>

	<p>I then realized that most all of the farming done nearby is of vineyards, whose demands as far as equipment is concerned are rather light: save for the occasional skinny tractor all the equipment required can be stored in a garage.</p>
