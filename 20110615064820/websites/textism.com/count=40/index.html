	<h3><a href="/article/732/" title="Permanent link to this article">Stalin&#8217;s Bullet List</a> - 3 June 03</h3>
	<blockquote>Imagine a widely used and expensive prescription drug that claimed to make us beautiful but didn&#8217;t. Instead the drug had frequent, serious side effects: making us stupid, degrading the quality and credibility of our communication, turning us into bores, wasting our colleagues&#8217; time. The side effects, and the resulting unsatisfactory cost/benefit ratio, would rightly lead to a worldwide product recall.<br />
&#8212;from Edward Tufte&#8217;s new leaflet, <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/436295572/tufte/books_pp" title="">The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint</a>, which just came in the mail.</blockquote>

	<p>Edward Tufte must be up there with David Foster Wallace and Stephen Hawking on the list of authors whose books are reflexively snapped up by their intended audience, yet rarely read. Most every corporate design shop in the English-speaking world keeps Tufte hardcovers on conspicuous display in studio and waiting area; mention of his name can divide a room of creative humans between those out-snorting each other with derision and those betraying the sort of baffled reverence given to an abrasively sarcastic deity.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not that the books don&#8217;t <em>try</em> to be read: each is a virtuoso performance of modern book work, impeccably typeset and laid out, stubbornly free of compromise and concessions to the bottom line. I&#8217;ve never been fond of their shape, but that&#8217;s me. The arguments are strong and elegantly presented, with Tufte&#8217;s central, ongoing (and, here, vastly reduced) theme &#8211; that data deserves unencumbered presentation &#8211; ringing out in example after glowing example.</p>

	<p>But as perfectly logical as his methods are, and as illuminating as his comparisons can be, Tufte&#8217;s advice usually has little relevance to a designer working in the arena of business, where the impulses of competition lead to work that first distinguishes the brand or the designer, and where the pressure and speed of money leave little room for the &#8216;design, think, design, think some more&#8217; approach in which Tufte passionately believes, yet which ironically leaves open canyons of room for the <span class="caps">BOGSAT </span>(bunch of guys sitting around a table) approach that is the gravitational force of commercial design.</p>

	<p>But the books are lovely to flip through while, oh, waiting for the steamer to adjust from espresso to milk setting.</p>

	<p><cite>The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint</cite>, 24 self-covered pages to tide us over until Tufte&#8217;s next book, <cite>Beautiful Evidence</cite>, looks to be similarly unlikely to budge too many people from bad design habits, like the millions now working up presentations in PowerPoint (AutoContent is just too killer an app, and don&#8217;t forget WordArt). But, as a hilarious collection of pot-shots at the ludicrous meatgrinder of ideas that is PowerPoint, it is one satisfying read. The data is of course unimpeachable, and the examples are exactly right, but one wishes the key points were presented in a breezier style, like, oh, a bulleted list, with some lively colours and graphics. Ahem.</p>

	<p>If I were to grouse, there&#8217;s Tufte&#8217;s usual tendency to downplay the significance of words and their meaning in design, preferring to evaluate data as something to be appreciated more on its visual gestures rather than the concurrent swirl of visual-textual meaning that must be parsed by those seeing information for the first time.</p>

	<p>Get it. It&#8217;s only seven bucks. You have to love that he gives over the entire centre spread to Peter Norvig&#8217;s <a href="http://www.norvig.com/Gettysburg/" title="">Gettysburg PowerPoint Presentation</a></p>

	<p>Since it&#8217;s my birthday, and since I&#8217;m fully in the swing of <em>asking for</em> rather than <em>delivering</em> things on this site, I wonder if anyone in the States taped the third season of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/" title="">Six Feet Under</a>, and would be willing to trade a dub for something from over here, like, say, the complete films of Serge Gainsbourg, or a selection of the nightly half-hour specials heralding the upcoming sixtieth birthday of Johnny Hallyday for the last twelve years. Or maybe something useful.</p>
 

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/730/" title="Permanent link to this article">Hat Passed</a> - 2 June 03</h3>
	<p>Well, heck. The response to the request for donations below has been truly remarkable, and the generosity quite humbling. We&#8217;re breathing easier around here, and the gratitude is boundless.</p>

	<p>Though there was less schadenfreude than expected, I did enjoy this:</p>

	<blockquote>So, after spouting hither and yon, for what seems like umpteen years, your idiosyncratic peeves, dressed drolly in smug repartee, picking nits with everyone and everything from: vacationing Britons to automobiles to celebrities to typography to Shrub presidents to smelly feet to head colds to css to xml to etc. to etc. to etc.&#8212;Then suffering upon us (your precious readers!) the endless yet endlessly maudlin, parade de bourgeois&#8230;happy puppy snuggling, happy puppy sleeping, happy puppy yapping, happy puppy wistful, happy puppy contemplative, happy puppy roustabout, happy puppy stubborn, happy puppy in repose, then finally and brutally sequeled with happy puppy 2.0&#8230;You ham-fistedly foist upon us (your precious readers!) a beggarly call for, &#8220;Alms, Sir? Alms for the poor?&#8221;. Oh how the mighty have fallen! Just how did &#8220;himself&#8221; find hisself in such dire straits? Angel funding fall through for the supposed &#8220;Extraordinaire-CMS-du-Jour&#8221;? Afternoons spent romping with dogs in the French countryside not paying what it used to? Tough market for navel-gazing bloggers? Pray do tell! Ah well, nevermind, the means to this end&#8230;It is not for us (your precious readers!) to ask why. After all, what would our dear sweet precious infinite internet be without your infinitesimal and occaisionaly irritating grain wafting through its midst? $10 US paypal dollars have been whisked to your account.</blockquote>

	<p>Woo!</p>
 

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/729/" title="Permanent link to this article">Hat Passing</a> - 27 May 03</h3>
	<p>Thing one. Working 12&#8211;14 hours a day for months at a time on an open source content management system (writing, rewriting, re-rewriting) may be just tons of fun and good for the soul besides (I see it in the eyes of the haggard, batty dude in the mirror), but it does not pay.</p>

	<p>Thing two. We&#8217;ve learned that the draughty old stone house in which Herself and I and the kids and the dogs presently sleep, eat, and laugh at each other&#8217;s bodily noises is being given, as part of a clever tax manoeuvre, to the landlord&#8217;s son. And so, sooner than we&#8217;d thought, we now begin to work toward buying, and renovating, and eventually living in, the abandoned draughty old stone house up the road.</p>

	<p>Things three and four are important, but not really your concern.</p>

	<p>And so and so.</p>

	<p>And so if in some way you&#8217;ve found your life improved by the words, pictures and software made available on this site, perhaps you&#8217;d consider <a href="/bucket/hat" title="">giving something in return</a>.</p>

	<p>It would be appreciated.</p>
 

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/728/" title="Permanent link to this article">Restoration</a> - 27 May 03</h3>
	<p>Things are slowly getting back to normal around here. <a href="/tools/textile/" title="">Textile</a> is back up, and the <a href="/resources/cleanwordhtml/" title="">Word <span class="caps">HTML </span>Cleaner</a> has been rewritten from scratch: it should now auto-detect which character encoding the <span class="caps">HTML</span> was saved in, and deal with cleanup and conversion accordingly. It also now brags about how much smaller the converted file is compared to the original cruft.</p>
