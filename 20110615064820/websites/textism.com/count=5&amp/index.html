	<h3><a href="/article/773/BagelandSchmeerinRuralFrance" title="Permanent link to this article">Bagel and Schmeer in Rural France</a> &#183; 23 December 03</h3>
<p><em>A Primer</em></p>

	<p>Not really one for rituals, but on frequent bleary Sunday mornings back in Vancouver I&#8217;d journey far across the Burrard Street bridge to the Siegel&#8217;s on Cornwall, to buy bagels just out of the oven, lox, and tubs of Winnipeg cream cheese.</p>

	<p>It is a salient truth that every human should find the <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/12/22/bagels">bagel</a> to which they are aligned by fate; for me it was plain (sometimes the poppy) at Siegel&#8217;s. I could foghorn on about texture and crumb and a balance of salt and sweet, but they were just really good. With lox, cream cheese, capers, and red onion they were heaven.</p>

	<p>The inability to acquire, or replace, these bagels since moving two and a half years ago has been difficult. Bread is of course like a religious object here, but they just don&#8217;t get bagels. When you can find them they&#8217;re no better or worse than those of the Safeway bread aisle: er, awful. </p>

	<p>From peering past the unemployed actors on cash at Siegel&#8217;s I always assumed there was some dark big-city science to bagelry; that it boiled down (sorry) to massive wood-burning ovens, iron kettles and long wooden paddles. But, thanks to this neat new thing called &#8216;google&#8217;, we have found you can get close even if cinching your burlap clothes with twine, kicking chickens out of the way barefoot in a dirt-floor kitchen, etc..</p>

	<p>It can be done.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">THE BAGEL</span>: This is of course the heavy lifting. Herself found <a href="http://www.tastingmenu.com/recipes/favorites/bagels.htm">this recipe</a> by Hillel Cooperman, and it is a keeper, with the following adjustments:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>For the malt syrup, substitute a tablespoon of Ovomaltine.</li>
		<li>A teaspoon of rock salt isn&#8217;t enough: make it two.</li>
		<li>1/3 cup honey in the boiling bath isn&#8217;t quite enough: make it a half cup.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We&#8217;ve made them twice (well, she made them twice; I interfered on the second batch) and they get very close to bagel nirvana: a little sweet with just enough crusty resistance and chewy and light but still substantial on the inside. </p>

	<p><span class="caps">THE CREAM CHEESE</span>: plain Recettes de Madame Lo&#239;k in the blue &#38; white tub does fine &#8211; not quite as unctuous as one might prefer, but can be thinned with milk. Vache qui rit in foil cubes is mere greasy kid stuff.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">THE CAPERS</span>: Available most anywhere. Maille are good. </p>

	<p><span class="caps">THE RED ONION</span>: Why are these so goddam expensive here?</p>

	<p><span class="caps">THE SMOKED SALMON</span>: Available most anywhere, pre-sliced and vacuum sealed. Scottish is better than Irish; both are better than Norwegian. If it&#8217;s labelled <em>carpaccio de saumon,</em> well, you don&#8217;t buy such foodie bunkum.</p>

<p>For the moment this information will be useful to a small roomful of people, but this site is now serving an <a href="http://textism.com/?atom=1">Atom 0.3 feed</a>. It should <a href="http://feedvalidator.org/check?url=http://textism.com/?atom=1">validate</a>. I&#8217;d be grateful to hear if it breaks elsewhere. </p>

	<p>Having planned all along for Atom support in rhymes-with-vexed-slattern, I&#8217;ve finally got around to it now that the <a href="http://www.mnot.net/drafts/draft-nottingham-atom-format-02.html">spec</a> is looking pretty solid with version 0.3. </p>

	<p>For those to whom this is all Greek, Atom is a new form of AI technology that visits all websites simultaneously, looking for anyone badmouthing you or those batting for your team; it responds by firing back custom-made insults and denunciations including but not limited to accusations of hypocrisy and pot-kettle-black.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/771/EndoftheAnimalKingdom" title="Permanent link to this article">End of the Animal Kingdom</a> &#183; 21 December 03</h3>
<p>It turns out the wackily ponderous movie made in Pompignan last year (shooting of which complained about <a href="/article/593/">here</a>, brief review by Herself of hometown showing <a href="http://www.openbrackets.com/article/515/">here</a>) isn&#8217;t going straight to TV after all &#8211; we&#8217;d heard it was going to show on Arte sometime around now &#8211; it&#8217;s been <a href="http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=47700.html">released in cinemas</a>.</p>

	<p>If you&#8217;re near a major French city and possessed of nothing better to do, you can head out see our very own little red-haired kid in his star turn as &#8220;little red-headed kid in schoolhouse&#8221;, No&#235;l the vigneron as &#8220;guy in baseball cap&#8221;, the old guy on a bicycle leading his white horse down the main street as he does every day, lots of purdy <em>haute garrigue</em> scenery, and much else besides, in a largely unsatisfying study of longing, sensuality, death and sheep. </p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not that bad. In many ways it&#8217;s like a two-hour love letter to our little village.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/770/Hardware" title="Permanent link to this article">Hardware</a> &#183; 19 December 03</h3>
<p>I like my iBook. Its name is Snowy. Here&#8217;s what it&#8217;s missing:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>A way to easily disable the caps lock key, for those of us whose large clumsy hands keep hitting it by mistake.</li>
		<li>Better yet, no caps lock at all: for such a rarely-used key it takes up inordinate space on the keyboard. You could lock and unlock caps by hitting Shift twice, no?</li>
		<li>A low-wattage FM transmitter, so audio can be played through a home stereo without mucking with jacks and cables.</li>
		<li>Somewhere else for the <span class="caps">CPU</span>. Even with <a href="http://www.roadtools.com/">ample circulation</a> the heat buildup under the heel of my left hand is <em>annoying.</em></li>
		<li>Better access to the function keys. I&#8217;m roughly four times more interested in using f-keys than I am in Expos&#233; or adjusting volume or screen brightness, yet I have to use a combination of keys to get to them.</li>
		<li>A full stop/period/dot/whatever that doesn&#8217;t require the shift key (particular to <span class="caps">AZERTY</span> keyboards but a pain nonetheless).</li>
		<li>The ability to close the screen without it going to sleep, so it can operate as an unobtrusive stereo component, server, downloader, whatever.</li>
		<li>It should sense whenever I enter the room and immediately begin playing <em>Back in Black</em> by AC/DC.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Just wanted to get that out.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Gruber</a> and others kindly point to <a href="http://gnufoo.org/ucontrol/ucontrol.html">uControl</a>, a kernel hack that solves the caps lock and fkey problems and appears to pick up dry cleaning as well. It behaved a bit flakily when first installed, owing to a lack of 10.3.2 updating on my part.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE 2</span>: I was joking, but several people wrote to say that with a combination of a Bluetooth adapter, a Sony/Ericsson shoe phone and <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/jonassalling/Shareware/Clicker/">this</a> freakish innovation, I can in fact have <em>Back in Black</em> begin to play whenever I enter the room. God blind me.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE 3</span>: It might be noted that in the original Tintin, Snowy is called <em>Milou.</em> Thomson and Thompson are <em>Dupont et Dupond.</em> Freaking Belgians.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE 4</span>: Oh! Oh! I forgot the most important missing thing of all &#8211; a way to turn off the damned glowing <span class="caps">HEY I</span>&#8217;<span class="caps">M</span> REALLY <span class="caps">ASLEEP</span> light that, in the pitch-black rural night, can seem like a neon motel sign forever blinking <em>vacancy.</em> </p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE 5</span>: Screw the iBook &#8211; <a href="http://www.leatherman.com/products/tools/wave/">this is the best thing ever</a>.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">UPDATE 6</span>: There is no update 6.</p>
