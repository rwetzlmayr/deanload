	<h3><a href="/article/712/" title="Permanent link to this article">Ring</a> - 6 April 03</h3>
	<p>Neither as a spectacle of entertainment, nor as a thing to run away and join, I&#8217;ve never understood the circus. I think we went as a family to one when I was a kid, but in memory it was loud and scarily dark. And nothing in adulthood has led me to wonder why there wasn&#8217;t more circus in it: I spent the relevant passage of <cite>Wings of Desire</cite> wondering why Peter Falk was in the movie. What after all are a tent and some animals and men dressed as clowns compared to the rich reward of hours spent feasting on sweet, opiate television or clicking from one blogroll to the next, or dozing with a fat novel on your face. I ask you.</p>

	<p>Having spent most every nonhorizontal moment of the last few months ensnared in the Project at Hand &#8211; scowling at a computer screen, blaspheming all the while &#8211; it barely registered when a few weeks ago Herself mentioned that an Italian circus was coming to Montpellier, and that she&#8217;d ordered tickets.</p>

	<p>Okaygreatsoundsgood. Clicky clicky scowl scowl.</p>

	<p>And boom came the day, yesterday. I was noisily extracted from the computer and, with the little redhaired kid and the formidable daughter nattering in the back seat, we rolled like hillbillies to the state fair, down through and past Montpellier, to the Parc des Expositions, out by the airport.</p>

	<p>(You know that day when, for the first time since the previous autumn, you put your hand out the car window and feel no bite in the air? That was yesterday.)</p>

	<p>Popcorn needs were met, into the big tent and we were seated. Trapeze artists, acrobats, gymnasts, a juggler; mercifully only one clown. People standing on galloping horses, small shetlands moving in unison, elephants. No tigers. A woman who swung five steel hoops at differing rates on her hips. Fire breathing, fire juggling, the throwing of knives on fire. Other than the occasional bit of synth fizzing out of the loudspeakers (and, I suppose, the loudspeakers), there were practically no concessions to modern entertainment: just physical skill and timing, and too much eye makeup.</p>

	<p>I loved each and every minute of it. Except for the irritating woman who had some sort of problem with us taking their front row seats at intermission (you want impressive, you should see Herself curse someone out in French), it was a perfect day out.</p>

	<p>Some time this weekend &#8211; during the time it took for my aging, perforated brain to wrap itself around (come to accept, perhaps) the fairly rudimentary and time-proven concept that a variable created inside a function won&#8217;t necessarily be available the next time the function is called, particularly if called from an entirely different document &#8211; a Rubbermaid food container containing carrot and celery sticks in water slipped to the back of the fridge and began to <a href="/bucket/armada.html" title="">freeze</a>.</p>
 

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/709/" title="Permanent link to this article">Something Soup</a> - 24 March 03</h3>
	<p>Put a soup pot over a low fire, and chuck in a really rather unreasonably large quantity of unsalted butter. While it melts, peel and dice (thup thup thup) a couple white or yellow (not spanish, not vidalia) onions. Make sure any stray onionskin has been removed; it will bring disappointment later. Also don&#8217;t breathe through your nose while dicing unless you enjoy tears and pain. Into the pot.</p>

	<p>Key thing here is to sweat out some of the sugars from, but under no circumstances brown, the onions. Keep the flame low and stir frequently with a wooden spoon, ideally the kind that&#8217;s sort of squared off at the end so you can scrape up anything that gets stuck. If, due to your own inattentiveness, hard dry bits of onion appear and the whole lot begins to caramelize, abandon the project and go away until you&#8217;re ready to take this seriously.</p>

	<p>Pare, rinse, and roughly chop a reasonable quantity (say, as much as you can scoop up with both hands in two gos) of something.<sup>1</sup> Once the onions are nearly translucent, turn up the heat, add in the something, and stir and turn and toss and shake the pot until everything sizzles and any water that came with the something has evaporated. Should be a couple minutes.</p>

	<p>As you know, it&#8217;s easy enough to have chicken stock on hand. Simmer some chicken bones (if you have no bones, buy a couple of those family packs of chicken wings) in water for a few hours<sup>2</sup> with carrots, onions, celery, parsley stems, a bit of thyme and a few peppercorns. It&#8217;s impossible to screw up so long as you never let the stock come to a rolling boil, which will cause it to  become cloudy and gross.<sup>3</sup></p>

	<p>Add hot stock to the soup pot<sup>4</sup> until it seems like there&#8217;s enough. Bring it almost to a boil, then turn the heat down and simmer for precisely twenty one and a half minutes, then remove the pot from the stove. Dig out the Braun handheld doohickey and puree the soup until completely smooth, or transfer it in batches to the food processor or blender to achieve the same result.</p>

	<p>Check for salt, then stir in a really rather unreasonably large quantity of heavy cream. Serve in heated soup plates with croutons or a sprig of something nice.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>This could be broccoli, green beans, fresh peas, celery, artichoke hearts, cauliflower, carrots or asparagus tips; just about any vegetable, really.</li>
			<li>When the <a href="http://megnut.com" title="">Hourihan</a> /  <a href="http://kottke.org" title="">Kottke</a> alliance were here for a visit in November, this was Jason looking at a mess of sorry vegetables and used-up bones at the bottom of the stock pot: <em>You just going to throw that away?</em></li>
			<li>As long as the stock is brought to a simmer once a day it can go on almost perpetually: skim occasionally and ladle off what you need, and add chicken and aromatic vegetables whenever it seems appropriate. Keep the lid off overnight: the stock will only sour if left at room temperature with a lid on.</li>
			<li>There&#8217;s something resoundingly satisfying about ladling hot stock from one pot to another. I have no idea why.</li>
