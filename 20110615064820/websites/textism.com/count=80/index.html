	<h3><a href="/article/683/" title="Permanent link to this article">Textile</a> - 21 February 03</h3>
	<p><a href="/tools/textile/" title="">New and improved</a>, and available under an <a href="/tools/textile/license.html" title="">open source license</a>. With this official release there&#8217;s some new gadgetry, such as a handler for &#64;code&#64; &#8594; <code>code</code>, the ability to assign <span class="caps">CSS</span> classes to block elements, to assign a <code>cite</code> attribute to blockquotes, and a handler that tells Textile to leave your text the hell alone.</p>

	<p>You probably already know this, but <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com" title="">Brad Choate</a>, who is smart, asked if he could write a Textile plugin for Movable Type in Perl, <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/mttextile.php" title="">so he did</a>. Thank you Brad.</p>

	<p>Plain text to valid <span class="caps">XHTML</span> semantic markup with minimal fuss. Soon the syntax will be printed on millions of laminated cards, to handed out on urban streetcorners by schoolchildren on vacation. Nah.</p>

 

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/682/" title="Permanent link to this article">Cough</a> - 17 February 03</h3>
	<p>For the brave: <a href="http://www.textpattern.com" title="">Textpattern beta 1</a></p>
 

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/681/" title="Permanent link to this article">Construction</a> - 14 February 03</h3>
	<p>Some time ago I <a href="/article/608/" title="">wrote</a> about our friend No&#235;l the <i>vigneron</i> (like my mother, Holly, he was born on Christmas day), and of his decision to leave the local wine co-op to start a private winery. </p>

	<p>We had seen him and his wife Patricia only a couple times since: they were insanely busy, though the news updates were always good. At the potluck dinner after the elementary school&#8217;s holiday pageant in December &#8211; to which we had brought fried chicken and macaroni salad, and at which I failed to convey the concept, or even the appeal, of <a href="http://jargonbooks.com/whitetrash.html" title="">white trash cooking</a> (&#8216;well, no, not really <em>peasant&#8230;&#8217;</em>) &#8211; No&#235;l talked of investment from a Belgian wine dealer who was looking to buy land here, and of the haystack of paperwork he was navigating every day in addition to tending the vines. We also learned he had officially parted ways with the co-op, though apparently not before staring blankly at the seriocomic implementation of some of the modernization practices that he had been booted out as president just for proposing.</p>

	<p>They spent the Christmas holidays in South Africa, where they visited 28 different wineries. It was good.</p>

	<p>Last night No&#235;l came by to say he was giving us a tonne of compost for the garden (!), and to show one of the most fascinating sets of documents I&#8217;ve ever seen: the architect&#8217;s <a href="/bucket/archi.html" title="">plans</a> for the new <i>cave,</i> over <span class="caps">1,000</span> square metres in all, with tanks and vats and a pressing thingy and a glass-walled retail shop at one end. </p>

	<p>No&#235;l looks energized, transformed: a 50 year old man on the verge of something huge. You try explaining to such a person how your content management system is coming along.</p>

	<p>The compost, incidentally, is made from <i>marc,</i> the stuff (skins and seeds and whatnot) left over after the rasins have been pressed. Go figure.</p>
 

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/680/" title="Permanent link to this article">Character</a> - 13 February 03</h3>
	<p>Some time in the last couple weeks, while working on <a href="http://www.textpattern.com" title="">Textpattern</a> (you know, the <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> I&#8217;ve been using on this site for two years, the one that was running like a finely tuned and greased machine, the one I decided to release to the world, whereupon I was seized by a strange and insistent demon who was of the opinion that simply doing one thing and doing it well was not enough, boy, you need to attach a full-fledged browser-based <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> editing monster that would do several things in a kind of so-so sort of way but it sure would impress the twelve people to whom such a thing would even make any sense, and whereupon I tapped out lines of inelegant <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> code until droplets of blood formed on my forehead and I was hoarse from screaming <em>well why the fuck not</em> at a computer screen every time something refused to work &#8211; and of course things don&#8217;t work, things don&#8217;t like to work &#8211; and on it went until I was sufficiently unstupid to pause and grasp that having something that does one thing well is a good deal better than having many things that are just sort of so-so, and hey there&#8217;s all this time in the future to add those things when and if they <em>do</em> work, and I began the relatively swift process of dismantling all those flights of fancy until I arrived at the point I am now, which is ready to release a public beta) I discovered that one of the character-conversion utilities I was working on had potential use in the <a href="/resources/cleanwordhtml/" title="">Word <span class="caps">HTML </span>Cleaner</a>, which had been giving people problems lately. So I installed it and it seems to work.</p>

	<p>So go ahead, try it out. Just make sure to use the <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 character set when exporting from Word. </p>
 

<p style="text-align:center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><h3><a href="/article/679/" title="Permanent link to this article">Set of Steak Knives</a> - 10 February 03</h3>
	<p>I suppose it&#8217;ll be just a matter of time before accusations of rigging and taint cloud the air, before the burbling Attack Runts shit their collective underpants because InstaPoobah or &#8216;<a href="http://lilekswatch.blogspot.com/" title="">that hateful and nostalgic little monkey</a>&#8217; aren&#8217;t nominated, but it&#8217;s interesting nonetheless to learn that this site&#8217;s daily <a href="/oliver/daily/" title="">photos</a> of my dog Oliver (updated each day at 6 AM <span class="caps">CET</span> unless of course I forgot to put one up the night before which does happen now and again) are in the running for <a href="http://www.photojunkie.org/photobloggies/" title="">Best Pet Photo Blog</a> in the Photobloggies, an award that comes with a prize of a Red Rubber Devil Duck. No idea what that is, but it sounds pretty good.</p>

	<p>Big day for Oliver all around, as <a href="/oliver/pedigree.html" title="">this</a> arrived in the mail. He is now officially sanctioned (indeed, &#8216;highly recommended&#8217;) to bump nasties with hot bitches for money or bacon or what have you. </p>

	<p>A small private celebration, with ground beef and ear scratches, took place at midday.</p>
