<h3>Here <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/646/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">9 DECEMBER 02</span></h3>
	<p>To those presently trying without success to reach the web site of my most best beloved alpha biatch chicky-chicky, <a href="http://openbrackets.com">Gail Armstrong</a> (who just recently put thereon, alongside other good things, a lovely story about manifestations of the Upper Canada caste system at a garage sale): its <span class="caps">DNS</span> record is in the process of moving from one dead service to a living one; such information must be propagated to the four corners. A <a href="http://brackets.seeto.com">bivouac is here</a>.</p>

	<p>[It&#8217;s back now]</p>

	<p>Oh and hey: my thanks to all who&#8217;ve been sending in bug reports and sample problem files since the Word <span class="caps">HTML</span> Cleaner <s style="color:gray">meltdown</s> upgrade (see below). I&#8217;ll respond directly to everyone who has done so once it&#8217;s a-hummin&#8217; and free of its own gunk. </p>

	<p>This is an epsilon: &#949;</p>

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>You Know What? <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/645/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">8 DECEMBER 02</span></h3>
	<p>I recommend you read <a href="http://www.typographer.com/">typographer.com</a> because it is a good and informative site on the world-wide web, on which you will find all sorts of things to read about typography, outrage over the crimes carried out by the design industry, and mockery of Microsoft.</p>

	<p>Also because after my <a href="http://www.textism.com/article/629/" title="Supermarkets Nearby">vague grumblings</a> about the availability of cheddar cheese here in the land of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0670035696/ref=lib_rd_ss_TFCV/102-6821755-4556906?v=glance&#38;s=books&#38;vi=reader&#38;img=1#reader-link">infinite cheese variety</a>, typographer.com&#8217;s publisher, David John Earls, wrote from London to say he was going to send some. Which he then did, by Fedex. A massive wedge of blade-sharp cheddar that is reallyreallyreally good. I just had some. With an apple.</p>

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>Scrub <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/644/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">6 DECEMBER 02</span></h3>
	<p>I&#8217;ve rewritten the <a href="http://www.textism.com/resources/cleanwordhtml/" title="Word HTML Cleaner">Word <span class="caps">HTML</span> Cleaner</a> from the ground up. It should run faster, accept larger files, and retain a wider range of structure tags. </p>

	<p>I&#8217;m at something of a disadvantage as far as testing goes, though, as the French version of Office X I&#8217;m running will only produce proper Unicode entities for dodgy characters when generating <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 web pages, which would be fine if all the other code in those pages didn&#8217;t fail in browsers produced by, uh, Microsoft. Anyone finding strange results, please pipe up. </p>

<img src="/common/rule.gif" height="4" width="360" alt="" /><h3>Going Out <span class="permlink"><a href="/article/642/">::</a> </span> <span class="date">3 DECEMBER 02</span></h3>
	<p>The dog has been staring for a good hour, something he commences every day at 7:14 <span class="caps">AM</span> and works hard at, an inch or two from my face, until my eyes remain open and I roll out of bed to take him down the ladder, into a collar, and out in the world to unclench. </p>

	<p>On this morning I also need to unclench with some urgency. It&#8217;s not as bad as some days &#8211; when you wake up from fever dreams of speedboating across clear lakewaters with a terry towel in your mouth and a boiling vat of kerosene in your lap &#8211; no, it&#8217;s not as bad as it can be, but as I say there is some urgency. I groan and creak and it&#8217;s on with the clothes, the socks and shoes, down the steps and past the kitchen. Every day at this exact point there&#8217;s a debate: put coffee on the stove now so it&#8217;ll be ready upon return, or deal with the bodily functions and fuss over breakfast later. I put on the coffee.</p>

	<p>There&#8217;s an entranceway. About four metres square, just a sort of anteroom between the living room and the outside world. On two of its walls are hung coats and hats and collars and leashes; on the third is the big, heavy front door; on the fourth is the door to the toilet, right beside the door to the living room, which is the only thing that lays between all of these and a very bouncy eager dog and a groggy man who has to pee with, as I say, some urgency.</p>

	<p>I try the door handle and, instead of the usual resistance one gets after turning it 45&#176; or so, indicating the latch has cleared and the door can be opened, it just keeps going. I turn it the other direction, a full three sixty. The lock, which had been acting flaky, is now quite broken; the door is essentially deadbolted from within.</p>

	<p>Pause. Stare. Try again. Pause. Oh man. Options.</p>

	<p>Kicking it goes nowhere. Screwdrivers, then. Off comes the doorhandle &#8211; <em>all right Oliver just a minute</em> &#8211; and I hear the handle on the other side clank to the floor. No access to the mechanism of the lock, not that I&#8217;d know what to do with such access. Probing and digging with screwdrivers and pliers goes nowhere. <em>Just a </em>fucking<em> second Oliver.</em> No amount of hammer violence will loosen the hinge pins. On the stove, the milk boils over.</p>

	<p>I have visions of smashing through frosted glass, of axes splintering wood, of befouled houseplants and inappropriate use of the kitchen sink. I&#8217;m actually standing bent at the waist with half-crossed legs. Like in the movies.</p>

	<p>At last, at the bottom of the toolbox, I find a couple of wood chisels. I decide without conviction that such a door will be <em>easy </em>to repair, just a matter of patching on some laminate really (this sounds good at the time). I apply the tip of the chisel where I estimate the top of the lock mechanism to be and whack it with a hammer. A chunk of laminate the size of my palm comes flying off and <em>click</em> the lock opens and the door swings gently open. A flurry of activity ensues.</p>

	<p>Later in the day I&#8217;m trying to convey my needs to a hardware clerk, who has no problem selling me a new lock mechanism but can&#8217;t quite grasp why chisels and hammers were involved: all I needed to do was slip a credit card between the door and the frame. Like in the movies.</p>

	<p>There have been rumblings about me old mucker Joe Clark&#8217;s new <a href="http://joeclark.org/book/">book</a> over at a site called <a href="http://interviews.slashdot.org/interviews/02/12/02/1343246.shtml?tid=95">Slashdot</a>, which is apparently quite popular. The upshot was that the server run by the serene <a href="http://tripping.seeto.com">Luke Tymowski</a> (which hosts Joe&#8217;s many sites as well as those of mine, Herself and others) went kablooie for a while. Visitors presented with cryptic messages or empty pages in the last few hours may know this to be why. </p>

	<p>Kind of sweet that discussion of a book called <cite>Building Accessible Websites</cite> would render a bunch of websites inaccessible, no?</p>

<h3>What is It?</h3>

<p>When applied to a page arrived at via Google, this function will highlight the terms used for the Google search wherever they appear.</p>

	<p>To see Google Hilite in action, click through the first result on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=googlet&#38;q=fuck%20me" title="Google Search: fuck me">this Google search</a> (after the &#8216;sponsored link&#8217;) or the fifth (!) result for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;lr=&#38;ie=ISO-8859-1&#38;client=googlet&#38;q=verisign" title="Google Search: verisign">Verisign</a>.</p>

	<p>Table 1: a young couple are negotiating the terms of an end to their relationship. Two years next month. They, along with their friends, agree it is time, and this is to be an amicable split. Today, though, both are on the defensive. She is agitated, intractable; his calm seems forced and cold. </p>

	<p>Table 2: two men face a third. All wear three-button suits of no remarkable silhouette and matching facial hair. They have been drinking. What started two hours ago as a stiff, jokeless job interview has progressed to a potlatch bonding ritual of sorts, with reciprocated admiration and much bluster and agreement that one system is better than its alternative; it is ridiculous that all the world can&#8217;t admit this plain truth. </p>

	<p>Table 3: a college student (you can tell) seems, by the movement of her hand, to be crossing out passages in the pages of a textbook. A cup of cold coffee rests on a saucer at her elbow. </p>

	<p>Talks at Table 1 are at a standstill: she has said words intended to wound. He flinched the moment they hit the air. The couple is frozen, holding eye contact. An object on the table glows at the outskirts of periphery; they both know his lighter is the one thing he would not fail to grab when he decides to storm out. She covers it with her palm.</p>

	<p>The moat around Table 2 is fully dug, and the drawbridge is up. Enemies approach &#8211; to pour scalding coffee, steal plates, lob in the bill &#8211; but nothing penetrates. In tears, one of the partners tells of a childhood memory. He has unbuttoned his trousers. The others talk above him: something about the potential power of instant publishing. </p>

	<p>The student at Table 3, it turns out, is using a pink hiliter to highlight entire pages of text. Each word, each line, each paragraph.</p>
