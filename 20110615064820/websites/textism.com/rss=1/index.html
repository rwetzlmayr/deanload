<description>My pithy slogan</description>
<item><title>Liberty Logs</title>
<description>	&lt;p&gt;A usual Monday thing, addicted as we are to teh funny and equipped with, uh, a four mile high TV antenna: eating lunch on the sofa and watching the previous night’s &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons.&lt;/em&gt; This was the one about Homer finding himself romantic counsellor to a jock/bimbo marriage (Kris &amp; Anna Benson maybe?) on the skids. The episode – season ender of the 17th (!) season, and surprisingly good following a series of duds over the past few months – is notable for the best title sequence ever (when couches attack) and, I’m convinced, the best one-line gag in the history of television.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; jokes have of course usually been sharp and carefully crafted, and never &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; easy, but I don’t recall anything as perfect as the Duff blimp crashing on the baseball field and, thinking his wife is aboard, the Kris Benson character cries out, ‘This is the worst blimp crash ever!’. A millisecond after it takes your mind (well, my mind) to assemble the image of the burning Hindenberg, old Abe Simpson shouts from the stands: ‘Too soon!’. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It’s setup/laff done at the highest possible level. Just as you ask yourself ‘am I laughing at the Hindenberg?’, you realise the gag is &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; you even asking the question. Not a joke skirting around tragedy, which is easy, but a joke about the way we feel about jokes about tragedy. On the one hand it mocks the hubris and humourlessness of those who mine grief for agenda advancement, on the other it pokes at those (everyone, at one time or another, I suppose) whose laughter burns hottest at the point just beyond &lt;em&gt;too far.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;I laughed my head off. To the writer who came up with it: I owe you beer.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><title>What can I tell you</title>
<description>	&lt;p&gt;Gosh, thickest summer. It’s nice right now: Herself and I are swimming backstroke in a big big pool of quiet, as the kids are away with relatives for August. The roads are slow with Dutch sedans pulling caravans full of blond children. The town is overrun now and again, this weekend by thousands of doe-eyed, dreadlocked wastrels here to get baked and listen to &lt;a href=&quot;http://midafaya.over-blog.com/article-369834.html&quot;&gt;reggae&lt;/a&gt;. The vines are ripening, because the sun is relentless. The dogs, they pant.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Timewise, it’s still all about &lt;a href=&quot;http://textdrive.com&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://textpattern.com&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, the former now serving thousands of customers, growing in leaps and bounds, and the latter, after four years of fit/start development, to be officially Released to the world this week. Fancy that.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;And, hey, seriously, you should definitely know about &lt;a href=&quot;http://strongspace.com&quot;&gt;Strongspace&lt;/a&gt;, new from TextDrive: a superslick, supersecure, super-easy-to-use storage service that fills the gap for anyone wanting to restore a backup of their laptop from anywhere in the world, or wanting a secure archive of critical data, or a dropbox for sharing files, or just a big safe locker for anything they’d hate to lose. It’s downright neat.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>	&lt;p&gt;What on earth was the name of the Nabisco peanut butter cookies available in Canada until (at least) the mid-80s. Blue package, two biscuits, top one had a doughnut hole, stuffed with vaguely peanut-butterish filling. It is driving us batty.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worndoorstep.com/shop/images/biscutis&amp;bonbons/pirate-cookies.png&quot;&gt;Arrr!&lt;/a&gt; Thanks to all who wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
